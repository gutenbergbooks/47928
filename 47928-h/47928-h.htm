<h2><i>PREFACE</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> <i>the midst of the world war, when ordinary forms of celebration
seemed unsuitable, this book was conceived by</i> <span class="smcap"><abbr title="Robert">Robt.</abbr>
H. Ingersoll</span> <i>&amp;</i> <span class="smcap"><abbr title="Brothers">Bro.</abbr></span>, <i>as a fitting memento of the Twenty-fifth
Anniversary of their entrance into the watch industry, and
is offered as a contribution to horological art and science. Its publication
was deferred until after the signing of the peace covenant.</i></p>

<p><i>The research work for fact material was performed with devoted
fidelity and discrimination by Mrs.</i> <span class="smcap">Katherine Morrissey
Dodge</span>, <i>who consulted libraries, trade publications, horological
schools and authorities in leading watch companies. The following
were helpfully kind to her: New York Public Library,
New York City; The Congressional Library, Washington, D. C.;
Newark Public Library, Newark, New Jersey; The Jewelers'
Circular, New York City; Keystone Publishing Company, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">John J. Bowman</span>, <i>Lancaster,
Pennsylvania; Major</i> <span class="smcap">Paul M. Chamberlain</span>, <i>Chicago, Illinois;
Hamilton Watch Company, Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Mr.</i>
<span class="smcap">Henry G. Abbott</span>, <i>of the Calculagraph Company, New York
City, and others</i>.</p>

<p><i>Credit is also due to Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Walter D. Teague</span>, <i>the well-known
artist of New York City, who acted as art editor and supervised
the preparation of illustrations, typography and other art
and mechanical features</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The photographic compositions are the result of the enthusiasm,
the understanding and the art of Mr. <span class="smcap">Lejaren a' Hiller</span>, of
New York City. In this connection the courtesy of Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry
W. Kent</span>, Secretary of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York City, in permitting the use of collections of the museum
in the preparation of illustrations, is appreciated.</i></p>

<h2><i>FOREWORD</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a moonless night in No Man's Land. A man
in khaki stood silently waiting in a frontline trench.
In the darkness, his eyes were drawn, fascinated, to
the luminous figures on the watch-dial at his wrist. A
splinter of pale light, which he knew to be the hour-hand,
rested upon the figure 11. A somewhat longer splinter
crept steadily from the figure 12.</p>

<p>"Past eleven," he whispered to himself. "Less than
twenty minutes now."</p>

<p>To the right and to the left of him, he, now and then,
could see his waiting comrades in the blackness of the
trench, their outlines vaguely appearing and disappearing
with the intermittent flares of distant star-shells. He knew
that they, too, were intent upon tiny figures in small luminous
circles and upon the steady, relentless progress of
other gleaming minute-hands which moved in absolute
unison with the one upon his own wrist. He knew, also,
that far in the rear, clustered about their guns, were other
comrades tensely counting off the passing minutes.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes past eleven, the artillery bombardment
would begin and would continue until exactly midnight.
Then would come the barrage—the protecting curtain
of bursting shells behind which the khaki-clad figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>and his companions would advance upon the enemy's
trenches—perhaps also upon eternity.</p>

<p>How strangely silent it seemed after the crashing chaos
of the last few days! There were moments when the rumble
of distant guns almost died away, and he could hear
the faint ticking of his timepiece or a whispered word out
of the darkness near at hand. He likened the silence to the
lull before a storm.</p>

<p>Five minutes thus went by!</p>

<p>In another fifteen minutes, the fury of the bombardment
would begin; it would doubtless draw an equally
furious bombardment from the enemy's guns.</p>

<p>At twelve-ten plus forty-five seconds, he and his platoon
were to "go over the top" and plunge into the inferno of
No Man's Land. That was the moment set for the advance—the
moment when the barrage would lift and move
forward.</p>

<p>The slender hand on the glowing dial stole steadily onward.
It was ten minutes after now.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after eleven—just one hour plus forty-five
seconds to wait! His thoughts flew back to his home in the
great city beyond the sea.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after eleven—why that would be only ten
minutes after six in New York! How plainly he could
picture the familiar scenes of rushing, bustling life back
there! Crowds were now pouring into the subways and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>surface cars or climbing to the level of the "L's." This was
the third—the latest homeward wave. The five o'clock
people had, for the most part, already reached their homes
and were thinking about their dinner; the five-thirties
were well upon their way.</p>

<p>How the millions of his native city and of other cities
and towns, and even of the country districts, all moved
upon schedule! Clocks and watches told them when to get
up, when to eat their breakfasts, when to catch their trains,
reach their work, eat their lunches, and return to their
homes. Newspapers came out at certain hours; mails were
delivered at definite moments; stores and mills and factories
all began their work at specified times.</p>

<p>What a tremendous activity there was, back there in
America, and how smoothly it all ran—smooth as clock-work!
Why, you might almost say it ran <em>by</em> clock-work!
The millions of watches in millions of pockets, the millions
of clocks on millions of walls, all running steadily together—these
were what kept the complicated machinery of
modern life from getting tangled and confused.</p>

<p>Yes; but what did people do before they had such timepieces?
Back in the very beginning, before they had invented
or manufactured anything—far back in the days of
the caveman—even those people must have had <em>some</em>
method of telling time.</p>

<p>A bright star drew above the shadowy outline of a hill.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>At first the man in khaki thought that it might be a distant
star-shell; but no, it was too steady and too still. Ah yes,
the <em>stars</em> were there, even in the very beginning—and the
moon and the sun, they were as regular then as now; perhaps
these were the timepieces of his earliest ancestors.</p>

<p>A slight rustle of anticipation stirred through the waiting
line and his thoughts flashed back to the present. His
eyes fixed themselves again on the ghostly splinters of light
at his wrist. The long hand had almost reached the figure 4—the
moment when the bombardment would begin.</p>

<p>He and his comrades braced themselves—and the night
was shattered by the crash of artillery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE<br />

<small><i>The Man Animal and Nature's
Timepieces</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> story of the watch that you hold in your hand
to-day began countless centuries ago, and is as
long as the history of the human race. When our
earliest ancestors, living in caves, noted the regular succession
of day and night, and saw how the shadows changed
regularly in length and direction as day grew on toward
night, then was the first, faint, feeble germ of the beginning
of time-reckoning and time-measurement. The world was
very, very young, so far as man was concerned, when there
occurred some such scene as this:</p>

<p>It is early morning. The soft, red sandstone cliffs are
bathed in the golden glow of dawn. As the great sun climbs
higher in the eastern sky, the sharply outlined shadow of
the opposite cliff descends slowly along the western wall
of the narrow canyon. A shaggy head appears from an
opening, half-way up the cliff, and is followed by the grotesque,
stooping figure of a long-armed man, hairy and
nearly naked, save for a girdle of skins. He grasps a short,
thick stick, to one end of which a sharpened stone has been
bound by many crossing thongs, and, without a word, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>makes his way down among the bushes and stones toward
the bed of the creek.</p>

<p>Another head appears at the same opening in the cliff—that
of a brown-skinned woman with high cheek-bones, a
flat nose, and tangled hair. She shouts after the retreating
form of the man, and he stops, and turns abruptly. Then he
points to the edge of the shadow far above his, and, with a
sweeping gesture, indicates a large angular rock lying in
the bed of the stream near by. Apparently understanding
the woman nods and the man soon disappears into the
brush.</p>

<p>The forenoon wears along, and the line of shadow creeps
down the face of the canyon wall until it falls at last
across the angular rock against which the dashing waters
of the stream are breaking. The woman who has been
moving about near the cave opening begins to look expectant
and to cast quick glances up and down the canyon.
Presently the rattle of stones caught her ear and she sees
the long-armed man picking his way down a steep trail.
He still carries his stone-headed club in one hand, while
from the other there swings by the tail the body of a small,
furry animal. Her eyes flash hungrily, and she shows her
strong, white teeth in a grin of anticipation.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Cave Man and the Moving Shadow</span></p>

<p><i>"I'll be back when the shadow touches that stone." It was by
such crude expedients that our primitive ancestors timed their
engagements.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it has not been hard to follow the meaning of
this little drama of primitive human need. Our own needs
are not so very different, even in this day, although our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>manners and methods have somewhat changed since the
time of the caveman. Like ourselves, this savage pair
awoke with sharpened appetite, but, unlike ourselves,
they had neither pantry nor grocery store to supply them.
Their meal-to-be, which was looking for its own breakfast
among the rocks and trees, must be found and killed for
the superior needs of mankind, and the hungry woman had
called after her mate in order to learn when he expected to
return.</p>

<p>No timepieces were available, but that great timepiece
of nature, the sun, by which we still test the accuracy of
our clocks and watches, and a shadow falling upon a certain
stone, served the need of this primitive cave-dweller in
making and keeping an appointment.</p>

<p>The sun has been, from the earliest days, the master of
Time. He answered the caveman's purpose very well. The
rising of the sun meant that it was time to get up; his
setting brought darkness and the time to go to sleep. It
was a simple system, but, then, society in those days <em>was</em>
simple—and strenuous.</p>

<p>For example, it was necessary to procure a new supply
of food nearly every day, as prehistoric man knew little of
preserving methods. Procuring food was not so easy as one
might think. It meant long and crafty hunts for game, and
journeys in search of fruits and nuts. All this required daylight.
By night-time the caveman was ready enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>crawl into his rock-home and sleep until the sun and his
clamoring appetite called him forth once more. In fact, his
life was very like that of the beasts and the birds.</p>

<p>But, of course, he was a man, after all. This means that
a human brain was slowly developing behind his sloping
forehead, and he could not stop progressing.</p>

<p>After a while—a long while, probably—we find him and
his fellows gathered together into tribes and fighting over
the possession of hunting-grounds or what not, after the
amiable human fashion. Thus, society was born, and with
it, organization. Tribal warfare implied working together;
working together required planning ahead and making appointments;
making appointments demanded the making
of them <em>by</em> something—by some kind of a timepiece that
could indicate <em>more than a single day</em>, since the daily position
of light and shadows was now no longer sufficient.
Man looked to the sky again and found such a timepiece.</p>

<p>Next to the sun, the moon is the most conspicuous of the
heavenly objects. Its name means "the Measurer of Time."
As our first ancestors perceived, the moon seemed to have
the strange property of changing shape; sometimes it was
a brilliant disk; sometimes a crescent; sometimes it failed
to appear at all. These changes occurred over and over
again—always in the same order, and the same number of
days apart. What, then, could be more convenient than for
the men inhabiting neighboring valleys to agree to meet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>a certain spot, with arms and with several days' provisions,
at the time of the next full moon?—moonlight being also
propitious for a night attack.</p>

<p>For this and other reasons, the moon was added to the
sun as a human timepiece, and man began to show his
mental resources—<em>he was able to plan ahead</em>. Note, however,
that he was not concerned with measuring the passage
of time, but merely with fixing upon a future date; it
was not a question of <em>how long</em> but of <em>when</em>.</p>

<p>This presumptuous, two-legged fighting animal, from
whom we are descended, and many of whose instincts we
still retain, began to enlarge his warfare, and thereby to
improve his organization. For the sake of his own safety,
he learned to combine with his fellows, finding strength in
numbers, like the wolves in the pack; or, like ants and
bees, finding in the combined efforts of many a means of
gaining for each individual more food and better shelter
than he could win for himself alone.</p>

<p>For example, it was possible that a neighboring tribe,
instead of waiting to be attacked, was planning an attack
upon its own account. It would not do to be surprised at
night. Sentries must be established to keep watch while
others slept, and to waken their comrades in case of need.
Our very word "watch" is derived from the old Anglo-Saxon
word "<span xml:lang="ang" lang="ang">waeccan</span>," meaning "wake." And yet people
who tried to watch for long at a stretch would be apt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>doze. They must be relieved at regular times; it was a
matter of necessity, but how could one measure time at
night?</p>

<p>Where man has been confronted with a pressing problem
he has generally found its solution. Probably in this case
the stars gave him a clue. If the sky were clear, their
positions would help to divide the night into "watches" of
convenient length.</p>

<p>Thus did primitive man begin to study the skies. No
longer a mere animal, he was beginning, quite unconsciously,
to give indications of becoming a student.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER TWO<br />

<small><i>The Land Between the Rivers</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Now</span> we must jump over ages so vast in duration
that all of our recorded history is by comparison,
the merest fragment of time. During the prehistoric
period, known to us only by certain bones, drawings,
and traces of tombs and dwellings, and by a few rude
implements, weapons, and ornaments, we must think of
the human family as developing very, very slowly—groping
in the dawn of civilization while it ate and slept,
hunted, and fought, and, gradually spread over various
regions of the earth.</p>

<p>It was in this interval, also, that man learned the use of
fire and the fashioning of various tools. His club gave
place to the spear, the knife, and the arrow-head weapons
that were made at first by chipping flakes of flint to a sharp
edge. Then, as his knowledge and skill slowly increased, he
learned to work the softer metals and made his weapons
and his tools of bronze. Meanwhile, he was taught, by
observing in nature, to tame and to breed animals for his
food and use, and to plant near home what crops he wished
to reap, instead of seeking them where they grew in a wild
state. Thus, he became a herdsman and farmer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>He no longer lived in caves or rude huts, but in a low,
flat-roofed house built of heavy, rough stone, and, later,
of stones hewn into shape or of bricks baked in the burning
sunshine. Stone and clay carved or molded into images,
and the colored earth, smeared into designs upon his walls,
gave him the beginnings of art. And from drawing rude
pictures of simple objects, as a child begins to draw even
before knowing what it means to write, primitive man
came at last to the greatest power of all—the art of writing.</p>

<p>Through all this age man continued to regulate his expanding
affairs by the timepieces of the sky—the sun, the
moon, and the stars. He divided time roughly into days
and parts of days, into nights and watches of the night,
into moons and seasons—determining the latter probably
by the migration of birds, the budding of trees and flowers,
the falling of leaves and other happenings in nature. But
never guessing how greatly interested future generations
would be in the way he did things, he has left only a few
records of his activities and these have been preserved by
the merest accident. The historian and the press-agent
were the inventions of later days.</p>

<p>Thus we come down the ages to a date about 4000 B. C.
at the very beginning of recorded history, and to one of
the most ancient civilizations in the world—that of the
region which we now call Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia lies
in southwestern Asia between the Tigris and Euphrates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Rivers and not far from the traditional site of the Garden
of Eden. The name by which we know it comes from the
Greek, and means, "The land between the rivers" but the
people who dwelt there at the time to which we refer called
it the "Land of Shinar."</p>

<p>This is the region in which long afterward—so the Bible
tells us—Abraham left his native town, Ur of the Chaldees,
to make his pioneer journey to Palestine. This is the land
where the great cities of Babylon and Nineveh afterward
arose; Babylon, where Daniel interpreted the dream of
King Nebuchadnezzar, and Nineveh, whence the Assyrians,
the fierce conquerors of the ancient world, "came
down like a wolf on the fold" against the peaceful Kingdom
of Judah. It is the land where, thousands of years
later, the famous Arab capital of Bagdad was built; it is
the land of Harun al Raschid and the "Arabian Nights,"
and the land which the British Army conquered in a remarkable
campaign against the Turks and Germans.
Mesopotamia is a land of color, brilliant life, wonders and
romance. Many students and statesmen believe that it
will, in days to come, grow fruitful and populous again,
that it will once more be great among the countries of the
earth. It is a flat region, with wide-stretching plains. For
the most part, there are no hills to limit the view of the
skies, and the heavens are brilliant upon starry nights.</p>

<p>In this favored portion of the earth, a high civilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>had already been developed in the very earliest days of
which we have authentic historic record. The caveman
type had long disappeared and had been forgotten; people
were already living in well-built cities of brick and stone.
Their houses were low and flat-roofed, but the cities were
surrounded with high and massive walls to protect them
from enemies, and here and there within rose great square
towers which were also temples. Perhaps the famous
Tower of Babel was one of these, for Babel, of course, is
another name for Babylon, and its people are known to
have worshipped on the tops of towers, as if, by so doing,
they could reach nearer to their gods. The ancient Chaldeans
were religious by nature, and because the skies
contained the greatest things of which they knew, they
identified many of their gods with the sun, the moon, and
the stars, and they worshipped these in their temples.</p>

<p>Thus, the sun was the god <em>Shamash</em>, the moon was <em>Sin</em>,
Jupiter was <em>Marduk</em>, Venus was <em>Ishtar</em>, Mars was <em>Nergal</em>,
Mercury was <em>Nebo</em>, and Saturn was <em>Ninib</em>.</p>

<p>In consequence, their priests came to give much of their
time to a study of the movements of the stars. These
priests, who were shrewd and learned men, discovered a
great deal, but they kept their knowledge closely within
the circle of their caste. Learning was not for everyone in
those days because the priests posed as magicians able to
interpret dreams, to explain signs, and to foretell the future.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>This brought them much revenue; as prophets they were
not unmindful of profits.</p>

<p>When we consider that these astrologer-astronomers did
not have telescopes or our other modern instruments, it is
marvelous to see how many of the laws of the heavenly
bodies they really did find out for themselves. Books could
be filled, with the story of their discoveries. For example,
they observed that the sun slowly changed the points at
which it rose and set. During certain months, the place of
sunrise traveled northward, and at the same time the sun
rose higher in the sky, and at noon was more nearly overhead.
At this time, the days were also longer, because the
sun was above the horizon more of the time, and then it
was summer. During certain other months, the sun traveled
south again, and all these conditions were reversed;
the days grew shorter and shorter, and it was winter. This
is, of course, exactly what the sun appears to do here and
now, and we may observe it for ourselves. But these Babylonian
priests were the first to study these phenomena and
accomplish something by applying their reasoning powers
to the facts that presented themselves. They took the time
which was consumed in this motion from the furthest north
to the furthest south and return, and from that worked
out their year.</p>

<p>In order to calculate time, they next devised the zodiac,
a sort of belt encircling the heavens and showing the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of the sun, and the location of twelve constellations, or
groups of stars, through which he would be seen to pass if
his light did not blot out theirs. They divided the region of
these twelve constellations into the same number of equal
parts; consequently, the sun passing from any given point
around the heavens to the same point, occupied in so doing
an amount of time that was arbitrarily divided into
twelfths.</p>

<p>But they also devised another twelve-part division of
the year. They noticed that the moon went through her
phases, from full moon to full moon in about thirty days.
So one moon, or one month, corresponded with the passage
of the sun through one "sign" of the zodiac. Our own
word "month" might have been written "moonth," since
that is its meaning. That gave them a year of twelve
months, each month having thirty days, or three hundred
and sixty days in all.</p>

<p>Then from the seven heavenly bodies which they had
identified with seven great gods, they got the idea of a
week of seven days, one day for the special worship of
each god and named for him.</p>

<p>In like manner, they divided the day and the night each
into twelve hours; and the hour into sixty minutes and
these again into sixty seconds. The choice of "sixty" was
not a chance shot or accident; it was carefully selected for
practical reasons since these old astronomers were wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>and level-headed men. No lower number can be divided
by so many other numbers as can sixty. Just look at your
watch for a moment and notice how simply and naturally
the minutes, divided into fives, fit into place between the
figures for the hours, and, because sixty divides evenly
by fifteen and thirty, we have quarter-hours and half-hours.</p>

<p>Therefore, we should realize, with a bit of gratitude,
that we owe these divisions of time, of which we still make
use, to the ancient magician-priests of Babylon and Chaldea,
thousands and thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>In doing all this, these early scientists developed at the
same time an elaborate system of so-called "magic" by
which they pretended to foretell future events and the
destinies of men born on certain days. This was an important
part of their priestcraft, and probably it was not
the least profitable part. In fact, the priests called themselves
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magi</i>, meaning "wise men" in their language, and
our word "magic" is derived from "magi."</p>

<p>This <em>magic</em>, or prophetic study of the stars, we call <em>astrology</em>
to distinguish it from the true science of <em>astronomy</em>.
But mingled with it all, these priests possessed a wonderful
amount of genuine scientific knowledge. Their year of
three hundred and sixty days was, of course, five days too
short, as they presently found out for themselves. In six
years, the difference would amount to thirty days, which
was exactly the length of one of their months. So they corrected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>the calendar very easily by doubling the month
Adar once in six years. Thus, every sixth year contained
thirteen months instead of twelve; that was the origin of
the leap-year principle which we still use, although more
accurately. It can be seen that, with all their superstition
and their befooling of other people, the priests themselves
were by no means ignorant; they were really keen observers.</p>

<p>This calendar, by which we still measure the years and
the seasons, is so interesting a thing that it is worth while
to pause for a moment in our story in order to trace out its
later development. The Babylonian calendar remained
practically the same up to the time of Julius Caesar, only
a few years before the Christian Epoch. The names of the
months had naturally been changed into the Latin language;
and the Romans, instead of doubling a whole
month, had come to add the extra five days to several
months, one day to each. That is the reason for some of
our months having thirty-one days.</p>

<p>When Caesar was Dictator of Rome, it had become
known that the year of exactly 365 days was still a little
too short. It should have been 365&frac14;. So Caesar in reforming
the calendar, provided that the first, third, fifth,
seventh, ninth, and eleventh months should be given
thirty-one days each, and that the others should have
thirty days, except in the case of February which should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>have its thirtieth day only once in four years. A little
later, his successor, the Emperor Augustus, after whom the
month of August is named, decided that <em>his</em> month must
be as long as July, which was Julius Caesar's month.
Therefore, he stole a day from February and added one to
August; then he changed the following months by making
September and November thirty-day months and giving
thirty-one days to October and December.</p>

<p>The Julian calendar, with these changes by Augustus,
remained in use until the year A. D. 1582, nearly a century
after the discovery of America. Then it was learned that
the average year of 365&frac14; days was still not exactly right
according to the motion of the earth around the sun. The
exact time is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds,
being 11 minutes and 14 seconds less than 365&frac14; days.
When, therefore, we add a day to the year every four
years, as Caesar commanded, we are really adding too
much. This excess was corrected by Pope Gregory <abbr title="the twelfth">XII</abbr> in
1582, when he changed the calendar so that the last year
of a century should be a leap-year only when its number
could be divided evenly by 400. Thus, 1700, 1800, and
1900 were not leap-years, though the year 2000 will be.
This new calendar, which is the one now generally in use
in most of the world, is known as the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>Thus the plan and principle of the calendar, as well as
our smaller divisions of time, in spite of the small changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>by Caesar and Gregory, have remained from the Babylonian
days down to the present; and we have done nothing
to their system in all these thousands of years, except,
incidentally to correct it.</p>

<p>Only once in history have the measures of the ancient
calendar been set aside. That was in France at the time
of the Revolution, when the French people, in their passionate
hatred of all the traditional things that reminded
them of their past sufferings, invented a new calendar, in
which they changed the names of months and days, and
counted the years from 1792, the first of their liberty.
They also abolished all Sundays and religious festivals, and
divided the day into ten hours. This played havoc with
time-keeping, and caused great confusion. Watches and
clocks were made with one circle of numbers for the new
hours, and another, within, on which were shown the old
hours which people could understand. But this complication
lasted only a few years, for the traditional system
was soon restored.</p>

<p>To return again to the era of the first calendar. While
the wise men of Mesopotamia were engaged in mingling
science and mystery, another civilization, the Egyptian,
was developing upon the banks of the Nile and passing
through much of the same stages. In due course the Persians
conquered both Mesopotamia and Egypt and absorbed
their knowledge. Still later the wonderful Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>nation combined astronomy with mathematics in a way
which makes us wonder to this day. This is the way in
which civilization has grown. Race after race, during
century after century has added its new knowledge and
discoveries to that which has been learned before. It is
interesting to note that the astronomy of the Babylonians
appears to have been paralleled independently by other
ancient civilizations between which there was no apparent
possibility of intercourse. The Chinese in the East and the
Aztecs of Mexico, on the other side of the world, invented
practically the same astronomical instruments as the
Babylonians and made similar discoveries. All methods
of indicating time have been steps upon the long road
which has led to the making of modern timepieces.</p>

<p>The progressive Greeks did not permit knowledge to be
monopolized by the priesthood and probably their common
people knew more about the stars than most of the
population of America do to this day. Sailors possessed
no compasses, but they voyaged very skilfully with the
guidance of the stars, while farmers, lacking our modern
weather-reports and crop-bulletins, learned to govern their
planting and harvesting by the positions of the heavenly
bodies.</p>

<p>In one sense, this is time-telling and in another it is not,
but our ideas of time and astronomy have always been so
closely associated that it is hard to think of one apart from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>the other. This is because the movements of the earth,
which produce night and day and the changes of the seasons,
are our supreme court of time, our final standard for
its measurement. And since we cannot see the earth move,
we judge of its motion by the apparent movement of the
heavenly bodies, just as we realize the movement of a
train by watching the landscape rush past us as we go.</p>

<p>Some of the great Greek scientists, by the way, had
even learned to foretell eclipses of the sun. According to
Herodotus the one which occurred on May 28th, in the
year 585 B. C., was predicted by Thales of Miletus, one of
the famous "Seven Wise Men." This event was also celebrated
because of another interesting association; it
stopped a battle between the armies of the Medes and the
Lydians. Perhaps we can guess at what happened. Undoubtedly
the eclipse was interpreted by the armies as a
sign of divine anger, for the ancients identified many of the
forces and objects of nature as gods, and Phoebus Apollo,
who it was believed daily drove his flaming chariot across
the sky, was the great divinity of the sun. Furthermore,
these gods were very apt to meddle with happenings upon
the earth, particularly with wars, as anyone who has read
the "Iliad" will recall.</p>

<p><i>The Chaldean priests in ancient Mesopotamia told time by the
stars, thus combining science with religion.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Imagine, then, the two armies about to go to battle when
suddenly something appeared to go wrong with the sun.
There to their amazement, in a cloudless sky, a dimming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>shadow touched the edge of the sun's shining disk and
began slowly to blot it out. The warriors forgot to fight
each other and stared in terror at the sky. The sun
dwindled to a crescent; a weird twilight fell upon the
earth. Finally, the last thread of brightness disappeared
leaving a dull circle in the sky, surrounded by faint bands
of light. The gloom of night fell upon the ground. Birds
and animals went to their rest.</p>

<p>No further evidence was needed by the superstitious and
frightened soldiers. It must be true that Phoebus Apollo
was grievously angered, and they forthwith laid down their
arms. The sun god, of course, soon showed his approval of
this action by coming back into the sky.</p>

<p>This is only one of many tales which might be told to
show the state of superstition in those days. Learning,
then, was confined to the few, and in many instances
was used to mystify or terrorize the mass of the people
and thus keep them submissive. At best, new ideas were
slow to grow or to be believed.</p>

<p>For example, Pythagorus, the great Greek philosopher
of the sixth century B. C., believed the earth to be a globe,
but it was not until Columbus discovered America—twenty
centuries later—that people generally began to
know that it was not flat. Even in these modern days of the
public school, the press, the telephone, the telegraph, the
wireless and other means for the wide-spread distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>of knowledge, how slowly does truth find its way to acceptance!
To this day, superstition is by no means dead.</p>

<p>Even Mark Twain, who scoffed at superstition all his
life, often said that, as he came into the world with Halley's
Comet, in the year 1835, so he expected to die in 1910, the
year of the comet's next appearance. Strangely enough, his
half-jesting prophecy was fulfilled, for he really did die in
that year.</p>

<p>Astronomers to-day can figure out in advance what is
to happen in the heavens with an exactness which would
have seemed magical in olden times, and is hardly less
astonishing even now. Their power is largely due to improved
scientific instruments, proficiency in mathematics
and greater accuracy in the measurement of time. Not only
is the date of an eclipse of the sun now known in advance,
but so also is the exact path of the shadow across the world,
and the instant of its appearance in any given place.</p>

<p>We now have glanced briefly at a few of the features
of early humanity's dependence upon the clocks of nature
and the way in which they influenced its manner of life.
We still depend upon these great primeval timepieces and
we do it for the most part unconsciously, for our master
clocks must still be set by the motion of the heavenly
bodies.</p>

<p>That motion, which now we know to be really the revolution
of our earth, is still the legislator and supreme court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>of time. But we have learned to make and carry everywhere
a wonderful machine, whose revolving wheels and
pointing hands keep tryst with the stars in the heavens and
move to the rhythm of wheeling worlds. And so familiar is
this talisman of man's making, that we forget to look beyond
it or think of time at all save as the position of the
hands upon the dial.</p>

<p>We carry with us carelessly a toy which tells tales upon
the solar system—our watch is a pocket universe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE<br />

<small><i>How Man Began to Model
After Nature</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">We</span> now have reached a point far ahead of our
story and must take a backward step. We have
been seeing man as a mere observer of nature;
but man doesn't stop with nature as he finds it—his
man-brain drives him forward; he must make improvements
of his own. Animals may live and die and leave
no trace save their bones, which for the most part soon
disappear, but man always leaves traces behind him. He
has always interfered with nature, or rather has modeled
after nature, seeing in her work the revelations of principles
and laws that he might utilize in varying ways for his
own benefit and progress. Our material civilization is built
up from the accumulated results of all this study and control
of nature by hundreds of millions of busy brains and
hands, through tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p>Here we are, then, living, in a sense on the top of the
ages of human history, like the dwellers on a coral island.
Hundreds of generations have toiled to raise the vast
structure for us, like the little coral "polyps" which build
their own lives into the mass, yet we take it all as a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>of course and rarely give a thought to the marvelous ways
by which it has come about. You may have just glanced at
your watch. To you, perhaps, a watch has always seemed
merely a small mechanism which was bought in a store.
That is true, and yet—remember this—the first manufacturer
who had a hand in producing that watch for you,
may have been a caveman.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate this development, let us return,
therefore, for another rapid view of prehistoric times; life
in its crudest form—one day much like another—a scanty
population, huddled in little groups in places naturally
sheltered—the simplest physical needs to be provided for—little
thought of the past or care for the future—time-reckoning
reduced to the single thought of appointment—no
reason for measuring intervals—in these and other respects
antiquity presented the greatest possible contrast to
our complicated modern life.</p>

<p>The long-armed man of our first chapter noticed that as
the sun moved, the shadows of the cliff also moved, as did
all other shadows. As he formed habits of regularity, it was
natural for him to perform a certain daily act when, perhaps,
the shadow of a certain tree touched upon a certain
stone. This would be a <em>natural</em> sun-dial.</p>

<p>But a thinner, sharper shadow would be easier to observe;
suppose, therefore, that some successor to the long-armed
man set up a pole in some open space and laid a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>stone to mark the spot where the shadow fell when the sun
was highest in the heavens. That would be an <em>artificial</em> sun-dial—<em>a
device deliberately planned to accomplish a certain
purpose</em>. The man who first took such a step was probably
the first manufacturer who had a hand in supplying you
with your watch. The shaggy mammoth, the terrible
saber-tooth tiger and the eohippus, the small ancestor of
our modern horse, must have been familiar sights when
time-recording at the hands of some rude, unconscious
inventor thus began the long story of its development.</p>

<p>One stone reached by the moving shadow would mark
only one point of time each day. Why not place two stones,
three stones, or even more and get more markings? Such a
procedure would be more useful because it would indicate
the time of other happenings in the course of the day. The
sun would pass across the skies and the shadow must travel
around the pole. What more natural than to place the
stones in a circle and get a series of these markings?</p>

<p>Of course, as the ages passed, life became more complex—not
complex as we would consider it to-day, but, as compared
with its rude beginnings. New habits were formed,
new needs developed, new activities were undertaken at
different periods.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the sprouting of modern civilization—the
beginning of that specializing of each man in his own
particular direction that has carried the world to its present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>high state of expertness in so many fields. Slowly
steadily, and inevitably this principle of specialization has
been developed. With the increase of laws, for example,
certain men came to give them special study and then to
sell their knowledge and skill to other men who had no
opportunity for such study. In course of time, the aggregation
of laws became so great that these lawyers were forced
to specialize among themselves; to-day, therefore, we find
a number of classes of law specialists. The same thing is
true of doctors who have limited their practise until we
find those who treat the eye only, or the lungs, the stomach,
or the teeth. Even the treatment of the teeth has been
subdivided, some dentists limiting themselves to extraction
and some of them even to the treatment of a single
disease of the gums.</p>

<p>Engineering, too, has branched like a tree and the
branches have branched again and yet again. Electrical
engineering has come to be divided into so many departments
that telephone companies employ specialists in
many branches of the engineering profession.</p>

<p>We find the same conditions in any field of thought or
activity—all commercial and industrial life is divided and
subdivided; labor is specialized; writing is specialized;
teaching is specialized; even warfare has become a contest
between many kinds of trained specialists, each employing
the tools of his trade; and every man's outlook upon life is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>directed chiefly toward the particular corner of the particular
field that he has fitted himself to occupy.</p>

<p>The first step toward this complex condition of the
modern world was taken when each man stopped getting
his own food, making his own weapons, and providing for
all his individual wants without dependence upon others.
When he learned to exchange that which he could best
produce for that which some other man had learned to
make better than he, the human race unconsciously turned
away from the status of the birds and the beasts and began
the long, slow upward climb that history records.</p>

<p>It was, then, through trade, barter and exchange that
man began to acquire the manners of civilized life. Trade
itself became a specialized activity, and dealers who did
nothing but buy and sell, but themselves produced no
material goods, found that a special calling was rightfully
theirs. The modern merchant is the heir of one of the first
"specialists" in human activity, and the misunderstood
work of the so-called "middleman" is one of the bases of
modern civilization—a necessary and honorable calling.</p>

<p><i>The "Dial of Ahaz" was probably a flight of curving steps
upon which a beam of sunlight fell. See Isaiah, <abbr title="38">xxxviii.</abbr></i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Civilization is a thing of the spirit, but it has the support
of material things and it has been truly said that the degree
of a people's civilization can be measured by the
multiplicity of its needs. The savage is content with food,
shelter and a covering for his body, but every step in
civilization's progress has a more and more complex material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>accompaniment, and these interwoven relationships
of modern life in which the question of time is a most important
factor can only be sustained through the use of
accurate time-measure. In other words, modern civilization
leans upon the watch.</p>

<p>But here again we have run somewhat ahead of our story
which, as a matter of fact, had only reached the point of
primitive sun-dials. But this anticipation will be excused
because of the importance of emphasizing that the growing
interdependence of human relations had made it necessary
to take into account the convenience of a greater and
greater number of people, and this involved closer and
closer time-recording in smaller divisions of time by more
exact methods.</p>

<p>The sun-dial underwent so many changes that a volume
would be needed to describe them all. For example, it was
found that the shadow of an upright stick or stone varied
from day to day, because, as we have already noticed, the
sun rises farther north in summer in the northern hemisphere
than it does in winter. So the mark for a certain hour
would change as the season changed, and the dial would
not indicate time accurately.</p>

<p>Berosus, a Chaldean historian and priest of Bel, or Baal,
a god of the old Babylonian, lived about the year 250 B. C.,
and hit upon a very ingenious way of solving this difficulty.
He made the dial hollow like the inside of a bowl. Into this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the shadow was cast by a little round ball or bead at the
end of a pointer that stood horizontally out over the bowl.</p>

<p>Now the sky itself is like a great bowl or inverted hemisphere,
and, howsoever the sun moved upon it, the shadow
would move in the same way upon the inside of the bowl or
hemisphere. And by drawing lines in the bowl, similar to
the lines of longitude upon the map, the hours could be
correctly measured. The "Hemicycle of Berosus," as it was
called, remained in use for centuries and was the favorite
form of sun-dial all through the classic period of Greece and
Rome. Cicero had one at his villa near Tusculum, and
one was found, in 1762, at Pompeii.</p>

<p>But the hemicycle was not easy to make unless it were
fairly small, and, if small, it was not very easy to read. You
can see that a shadow which traveled only a few inches in
a whole day would move so slowly that one could hardly
see it go. And the shadow of a round ball is not a clear
sharp-pointed thing like the hand of a watch, whose exact
position can be seen however small it may be. Besides, the
ancients were not very particular about exact timekeeping.
They had no trains to catch, and in their leisurely lives
convenience counted for more than doing things "on the
minute." So they still continued using the upright pointer
which the Greeks called the <i>gnomon</i>, meaning "the one
who knows."</p>

<p>"Cleopatra's Needle," and other Egyptian obelisks may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>also have been used as huge gnomons to cast their shadows
upon mammoth dials, for they were dedicated to the sun.
With an object of such great size the shadow would move
rapidly enough to be followed easily by the eye. But of
course its motion would be irregular because of the flat surface
of the dial. The word "dial," by the way, comes from
the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies</i> meaning "day," because it determined the
divisions of the day.</p>

<p>Then there was applied the idea of making the shadow
move over a hollow space, such as a walled courtyard,
going down one side, across, and up the other side as the
sun went up, across and down the sky. Sometimes light
was used instead of shadow, the place being partially
roofed over and a single beam of light being admitted
through a small hole at the southern end. Men kept track
of the motion of this beam as it touched one point after
another during the day.</p>

<p>Do you remember the miracle of the dial of Ahaz, mentioned
in the Bible? Hezekiah the king was sick and despondent,
and would not believe that he could ever recover
from his illness or prevail against his enemies. So the prophet,
Isaiah, in an effort to comfort the royal sufferer,
made the shadow return backward ten degrees upon the
dial of Ahaz, as a sign from heaven that his prophecy of the
king's future recovery was true. You will find the story
in Isaiah, Chapter thirty-eight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>This dial of Ahaz was probably a curved flight of steps
rising like the side of a huge bowl at one end of the palace
courtyard, with either a shadow cast by a pointer overhead
or a beam of light admitted through an opening. It
can be seen that this and similar great dials were applications
of the hemicycle idea on a large scale.</p>

<p>According to our chronology, the dial of Ahaz must have
been built during the eighth century, B. C. Although the
sun-dial period was, of course, many hundreds of years
older than this, yet the story of this Hebrew king and prophet
is the first authentic reference to a sun-dial which has
been discovered.</p>

<p>However, the final improvement of the dial was made
when it was discovered that by slanting the pointer, or
gnomon, exactly toward the north pole of the sky—the
point where the north star appears at night—the sun's
shadow could be cast upon a flat surface with accurate
results in indicating time.</p>

<p>This may sound simple, but if you will look at a sun-dial
such as may still be found in gardens, you will see that the
lines of the hours and minutes are laid out on certain carefully
calculated angles; you will realize that people had to
acquire considerable knowledge before they were capable
of making such calculations. The whole subject of dial-making
is so complicated that, in 1612, there was published
a big book of eight hundred pages on the subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>The angles of the lines of the sun-dial must be different
for different latitudes. It took that strong-arm race of ancient
times, the Romans, a hundred years to learn this
fact. The Romans, at this time, were developing their
civilization from the shoulders downward, while the
Greeks and some of the Greek colonies developed theirs
from the shoulders upward. Rome was a burly power, with
powerful military muscles. Whatever it wanted it went out
and took at the point of the sword, as some nations have
endeavored to do in latter days. Thus, the city of Rome
became a vast storehouse of miscellaneous loot—the fruit
of other men's brains and hands.</p>

<p>Some conqueror of that day took back with him a sun-dial
from the Greek colony of Sicily. This was set up in
Rome, where nobody realized that even the power of
Rome's armies was not able to transplant the angle of the
sun as it shone upon Sicily far to the southward. It was
nearly one hundred years before these self-satisfied robbers
found that they had been getting the wrong time-record
from the stolen instrument. Thus, the original owners had
a form of belated revenge, could they but have known it.</p>

<p>One of the largest of all the sun-dials was the one set
up by the Roman Emperor Augustus when he returned
from his Egyptian wars bringing with him an obelisk not
unlike the one which now stands near the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in Central Park, New York City. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>can imagine this Egyptian obelisk, with its strange hieroglyphic
characters upon its four sides, surrounded by a
great dial with the figures of the hours marked upon its
surface, you will get an idea of the size of this huge timepiece.
However, it was probably more picturesque than
valuable as a time-keeper.</p>

<p>There is an important difference between clocks and
sun-dials, aside from the self-evident one of the difference
in their construction. Clock-time is based on what is called
"mean time." If we study the almanac table of times of
sunrises and sunsets, and count the number of hours from
sunrise of one day to sunrise of the next, we find it is rarely
exactly twenty-four hours, but usually a few minutes more
or less, while the average for the whole year is twenty-four
hours. The clock is constructed to keep uniform time based
on this average length of day.</p>

<p>The sun-dial time marks "apparent time," the actual
varying length of each day. The sun-dial time, therefore, is
nearly always some minutes ahead or behind that of a
clock, the greatest discrepancy being about sixteen minutes
for a few days in November. There are, however, four
days in the year when the clock and the sun-dial agree perfectly
in the time they indicate. These days are April 15th,
June 15th, September 1st, and December 24th.</p>

<p>When in the eighteenth century clocks and watches began
to come into wide-spread use sun-dials fell into neglect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>except as an appropriate bit of ornament in gardens. At
Castletown, in the Isle of Man, is a remarkable sun-dial
with thirteen faces, dating from 1720.</p>

<p>It was usual to place on sun-dials appropriate mottoes
expressing a sentiment exciting inspiration or giving a
warning to better living. A dial that used to be at Paul's
Cross, London, bore an inscription in Latin, which translated
means, "I count none but the sunny hours." In an old
sweet-scented garden in Sussex was a sun-dial with a plate
bearing four mottoes, each for its own season: "After
darkness, light;" "Alas, how swift;" "I wait whilst I
move;" "So passes life." Sometimes short familiar proverbs
were used like: "All things do wax and wane;" "The
longest day must end;" "Make hay while the sun shines."</p>

<p>It is told of Lord Bacon, that, without intending to do
so, he furnished the motto borne by a dial that stood in the
old Temple Gardens in London. A young student was sent
to him for a suggestion for the motto of the dial, then being
built. His lordship was busy at work in his rooms when the
messenger humbly and respectfully made his request.
There was no answer. A second request met with equally
oppressive silence and seeming ignorance of even the existence
of the speaker. At last, when the petitioner ventured
a third attack on the attention of the venerable
chancellor, Bacon looked up and said sharply: "<em>Sirrah, be
gone about your business</em>." "A thousand thanks, my lord,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>was the unexpected reply, "The very thing for the dial!
Nothing could be better."</p>

<p>We see that the principle of the sun-dial has been recognized
and utilized for many centuries; indeed, we still find
sun-dials placed in gardens and parks although we rarely
take the trouble to look to them for the time. Like the
dinosaur and the saber-toothed tiger, they have had their
day. They have been forced to give way to devices that
overcame some of their objections; therefore we must not
linger too long upon what is, after all, a closed chapter in
the history of time-recording.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR<br />

<small><i>Telling Time by the Water-Thief</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Now</span> we must take another backward step of
thousands of years. In considering the subject of
time-recording, it seems necessary to wear a pair
of mental seven-league boots, for we must often pass back
and forth over great periods at single strides. While men
were still improving the sun-dial, its disadvantages were
already recognized and search was being made for some
other means of telling time.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that one had only a sun-dial
about the house; how would one be able to tell time after
sunset or on a dark day? How would one know the hour if
he were surrounded by tall buildings or a thick growth of
trees? And it might be very necessary to tell time under
any of these conditions.</p>

<p>Then, again, merely as a question of accuracy, the sun-dial
was not always reliable. It would get badly out of the
way if used by travelers, since different markings were
needed for different latitudes. While on shipboard the motion
of the waves would cause the shadow to swing around
in the most bewildering manner. Even under ideal conditions
it was never absolutely exact, because the apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>motion of our steady-gaited old sun is not quite as dependable
as most of us imagine.</p>

<p>Astronomers find that they must allow for what they
call "equation of time" in order to make their calculations
come out true. The question need not be discussed at this
point, but it can be seen that, as humanity left its earliest
care-free days and began to get busy, and hurried and
anxious over its affairs, it came to feel that after all the
sun-dial was not altogether sufficient for its needs.</p>

<p>For this reason we are now taking a third big backward
step, returning, this time, not to the caveman but to ancient
Babylon and Egypt, probably not less than twenty-seven
hundred years ago and possibly much longer. In this
way we meet the <i>clepsydra</i>.</p>

<p>The clepsydra was an interesting instrument, and it had
an interesting name, which meant the "thief of water" and
came from two Greek words meaning "thief" and "water";
you can trace this in our words "kleptomaniac" and
"hydrant." We shall now examine a timepiece that was
much more nearly a machine than was the simple shade-casting
sun-dial.</p>

<p>The original idea was simple enough. At first, it was
merely that of a vessel of water, having a small hole in the
bottom, so that the liquid dripped out drop by drop. As
the level within the jar was lowered, it showed the time
upon a scale. Thus, if the hole were so small and the vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>were so large that it would require twenty-four hours for
the water to drip away at an absolutely steady rate, it may
be seen that the side of the vessel might easily have been
marked with twenty-four divisions to indicate the hours.
It may also be seen that the water would drip as rapidly at
night or in shadow as in sunlight. And the clepsydra could
be used indoors, which the sun-dial could not, although it
required attention in that it must be regularly refilled and
the orifice must always be kept completely open, because
the slightest stoppage would retard the rate of dripping
and the "clock" would run slow.</p>

<p>The sun, which, with the other heavenly bodies, had
therefore been the sole reliance of the human race in its
time-reckoning could now be ignored and the would-be
timekeeper called to his aid another mighty servant from
the forces of nature—that of gravitation.</p>

<p>The most interesting human fact, however, about the
clepsydra is that it involved an entirely different conception
of the marking of time. Now it was not so much a
question of <em>when</em> as of <em>how long</em>. A good sun-dial set in a
proper position would always indicate three o'clock when
it <em>was</em> three o'clock, but the clepsydra might do no such
thing. It would merely show how many hours had elapsed
since last it was filled, and the steady drip, drip, drip of the
escaping water could—and did—lower the surface quite
as evenly at one time of day as at another.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>We have already seen that the first purpose in marking
time was merely for making appointments, but the clepsydra
shows that, with its invention, mankind had already
made some progress toward a new point of view. One important
factor in this change was the very practical need
of telling time at night, in stormy weather, or indoors,
where the sun-dial could not be used. The clepsydra, on
the other hand, worked equally well at any hour or place,
and in all sorts of weather.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it, too, proved to have certain faults.
After a time, people noticed the interesting fact that water
ran faster from a full vessel than from one which was
nearly empty; this was, of course, because of the greater
pressure. Since such a variation interfered with calculations,
they hit upon the idea of a double vessel; the larger
one below containing a float which rose as the vessel filled,
thus marking the hours upon the scale, and the smaller one
above, the one from which the water dripped, being kept
constantly filled to the point of overflow.</p>

<p>This improved form of clepsydra opened a field of fascinating
possibilities in time-recording—<em>it gave the chance
to make use of a machine</em>. There is, perhaps, no more interesting
point in studying human development than to see
the steady, inevitable way in which mankind from its cave-dwelling
days has tended toward machinery. Roughly,
this progress may be characterized as of three stages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>First. Primitive man—an upright-standing animal,
naked, unarmed, weak as compared with some creatures,
slow as compared with others, clumsy as compared with
still others—a creature with many physical disadvantages,
but with the best brain in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Second. The tool-using man, who had begun to grasp
weapons and to fashion implements, thus supplementing
his natural abilities by artificial means.</p>

<p>Third. The machine-making man, who has fashioned to
himself a mechanical "body" of incredible powers—that is
to say, he has learned to intensify his own powers through
artificial means which he has invented, as when he made
the telescope to give himself greater vision; he has made
inventions by means of which he can outrun the antelopes,
outfly the birds, outswim the fishes, outgaze the eagles,
and overmatch the elephants in sheer physical force—he
can turn night into day, can send his voice across the
continent, can strike crushing blows at a distance of many
miles and can carry the movements of the stars in his
pocket. Some phases of this third stage were foreshadowed
when man first applied wheels and pulleys to his clepsydra.</p>

<p>Here, then, was water steadily raised or lowered by
means of uniform dropping; here was a float whose motion
was controlled by that of the water; here, in fact, was
water-power with a means for applying it. Attach a cord
to the float, cause it to turn a wheel by use of the pulley-principle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>and the motion of the wheel would indicate the
time. Still better, rig up a turning-pointer, increase its
speed through the use of toothed gear-wheels, place it in
front of a stationary disk divided to indicate the hours,
and now the apparatus looked not unlike a modern clock.
Or attach a bell and let it be caused to ring at a certain
point in the motion—what
was that but an alarm-clock?
Ctesibus of Alexandra
was the one who is
believed first to have applied
the toothed wheels
to the clepsydra and this
was about 140 B. C.</p>

</div>

<p>Clepsydrae were expensive
of course; accurate
mechanical work was
never cheap until modern
times. Cunning craftsmen
spent their time upon
costly decorations, and these water-clocks became
triumphs of the jeweler's art, a gift for kings. Therefore,
like the sun-dial, they drifted into Rome—that vast maelstrom
of the ancient world. Imagine a great walled city
of low flat-roofed buildings, with fronts and porches of
great columns, a town mostly of stone and much of it of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>marble, gleaming white
under the bright Italian
sun, the streets thronged
with men in tunics and
togas and here and there
some person of importance
driving by, standing
erect in his chariot drawn
by four horses harnessed
abreast. And statues
everywhere, in the streets
and about the buildings
and in cool courtyards
and gardens among green
leaves. The ancients
thought of sculpture as
an outdoor thing, and
where we have one statue in the streets or public places of
our cities, they had a hundred. We treasure the remains of
them as artistic wonders in our museums, but they put
them indoors and out as common ornaments, and lived
among them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 213px;"><a id="i_055"></a>
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="213" height="400" alt="Clepsydra" />
</div>


<p>Presently we hear of the clepsydra being used in Roman
law courts by command of Pompey, to limit the time of
speakers. "This," says one writer of the day, "was to
prevent babblings, that such as spoke ought to be brief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>in their speeches." It is not difficult to picture some pompous
and tiresome togaed advocate, rolling out sonorous
Latin syllables as he cites precedents and builds up
arguments, while an unseen dropping checks the time
against him, and to hear his indignant surprise—and the
chuckles of his auditors—when the relentless water-clock
cuts him short in the middle of some period. Martial, the
Latin poet, referring to a tiresome speaker who repeatedly
moistened his throat from a glass of water during the
lengthy speech, suggested that it would be an equal relief
to him and to his audience, if he were to drink from the
clepsydra. But Roman lawyers were not guileless, and
sometimes, so we are told, they tampered with the
mechanical regulation or else introduced muddy water,
which would run out more slowly.</p>

<p>This suggests one of the difficulties of the clepsydra.
Still more serious was the fact that it would freeze on
frosty nights. There were no Pearys among the ancient
Romans; polar exploration interested them not at all; but
they did spread their conquests into regions of colder
weather—as when Julius Caesar mentions using the clepsydra
to regulate the length of the night-watches in Britain.
His keen mind noted by this means that the summer
nights in Britain were shorter than those at Rome, a fact
now known to be due to difference of latitude.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Clepsydra, or Water Clock</span></p>

<p><i>The Clepsydra, one of the earliest time-telling devices, was used
in Roman law courts to limit the time of speakers and "to prevent
babbling."</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>As late as the ninth century, a clepsydra was regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>a princely gift. It is said, that the good caliph, Harun-al-Raschid,
beloved by all readers of the "Arabian Nights,"
sent one of great beauty to Charlemagne, the Emperor of
the West. Its case was elaborate, and, at the stroke of each
hour, small doors opened to give passage to cavaliers.
After the twelfth hour these cavaliers retired into the case.
The striking apparatus consisted of small balls which
dropped into a resounding basin underneath.</p>

<p>The clepsydra appears to have been used throughout the
Middle Ages in some European countries, and it lingered
along in Italy and France down to the close of the fifteenth
century. Some of these water-clocks were plain tin tubes;
some were hollow cups, each with a tiny hole at the bottom,
which were placed in water and gradually filled and
sank in a definite space of time.</p>

<p>When the clepsydra was introduced from Egypt into
Greece, and later into Rome, one was considered enough
for each town and was set in the market-place or some
public square. It was carefully guarded by a civic officer,
who religiously filled it at stated times. The nobility of the
town and the wealthy people sent their servants to find out
the exact time, while the poorer inhabitants were informed
occasionally by the sound of the horn which was blown by
the attendant of the clepsydra to denote the hour of
changing the guard. This was much in the spirit of the
calls of the watchmen in old England, and later in our New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>England, who were, in a way, walking clocks that shouted
"Eleven o'clock and all's well," or whatever might be the
hour.</p>

<p>Allowing for the fact that the clepsydra was none too
accurate at the best and that its reservoir must occasionally
be refilled, it can be seen that this early form of timepiece,
having played its part, was ready to step off the
stage when a more practical successor should arrive.</p>

<p>With one of its earliest successors we are familiar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE<br />

<small><i>How Father Time Got His Hour-Glass</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Every</span> now and then one sees a picture of a lean
old gentleman, with a long white beard, flowing
robes, and an expression of most misleading
benignity. In spite of his look of kindly good humor, he
is none too popular with the human race and his methods
are not always of the gentlest. In one hand he carries the
familiar scythe, and, in the other, the even more familiar
hour-glass. By this we may assume that he began to be
pictured in this way while the hour-glass was still in common
use.</p>

<p>The principle of the hour-glass is so similar to that of the
clepsydra, and its first use was so early, that it is somewhat
of a misnomer to speak of it as a successor. About the only
justification that can be made is that the clepsydra has
long disappeared, while the sand-glass—if not the hour-glass—is
still sold in the stores for such familiar uses as
timing the boiling of eggs, the length of telephone-conversations,
and other short-time needs.</p>

<p>Nothing could be much simpler than the hour-glass, in
which fine sand poured through a tiny hole from an upper
into a lower compartment. It had none of the mechanical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>features of the later clepsydr&aelig;; it did not adjust itself to
astronomical laws like the perfected sun-dials; it merely
permitted a steady stream of fine sand to pass through an
opening at a uniform rate of speed, until one of the funnel-shaped
bowls had emptied itself—then waited with entire
unconcern until some one stood it upon its head and caused
the sand to run back again.</p>

<p>However, it possessed some very solid advantages of its
own. It would not freeze; it would not spill over; it did not
need refilling; it would run at a steady rate whether the
reservoir were full or nearly empty; it could be made very
cheaply, and there was nothing about it to wear out.</p>

<p>A water-clock might be of considerable size but a sand-clock,
since it required turning, must be kept small, and
an <em>hour-glass</em>—a size small enough to carry—became popular,
although its use was correspondingly limited. Thus,
it naturally was assigned to Father Time to be carried
before watches were available. A sun-dial simply would not
answer this purpose, since the old gentleman works by
night as steadily as by day.</p>

<p>How old is the sand-glass?</p>

<p>We do not know definitely, but it is said to have been
invented at Alexandria about the middle of the third century
B. C. That it was known in ancient Athens is certain,
for a Greek bas-relief at the Mattei Palace in Rome, representing
a marriage, shows Morpheus, the god of dreams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>holding an hour-glass. The Athenians used to carry these
timepieces as we do our watches.</p>

<p>Some hour-glasses contained mercury, but sand was an
ideal substance, for, when fine and dry, it flows with an
approximately constant speed whether the quantity is
great or small, whereas, liquids descend more swiftly the
greater the pressure above the opening.</p>

<p>Hour-glasses were introduced into churches in the early
sixteenth century when the preachers were famous for their
wearisome sermons. The story is told of one of these long-winded
divines who, on a hot day, had reached his
"tenthly" just as the restless congregation were gladdened
to see the last grains of sand fall from the upper bowl.
"Brethren," he remarked; "Let us take another glass," and
he reversed it—"Ahem, as I was saying—" And he went on
for another hour.</p>

<p>Other preachers, more merciful, used a half-hour glass
and kept within its limits. Many churches were furnished
with ornamental stands to hold the glass. These timekeepers
lingered along in country churches for many
years, but ceased to be in anything like general demand
after about 1650.</p>

<p>For rough purposes of keeping time on board ship, sand-glasses
were employed and it is curious to note that hour
and half-hour glasses were used for this purpose in the
British navy as recently as the year 1839.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>The very baby of the hour-glass family was a twenty-eight
second affair which assisted in determining the speed
of the vessel. The log-line was divided by knots, at intervals
of forty-seven feet, three inches, and this distance
would go into a nautical mile as many times as twenty-eight
seconds would go into an hour. When the line was
thrown overboard the mariner counted the number of
knots slipping through his fingers while his eyes were fixed
on the tiny emptying sand-glass, and in this way so many
"knots" an hour denoted the ship's speed in miles.</p>

<p>In the British House of Commons, even at the present
time, a two-minute glass is used in the preliminary to a
"division," which is a method of voting wherein the members
leave their seats and go into either the affirmative or
negative lobbies. While the sand is running, "division-bells"
are set in motion in every part of the building to give
members notice that a "division" is at hand.</p>

<p>It was an ancient custom to put an hour-glass, as an
emblem that the sands of life had run out, into coffins at
burials.</p>

<p>Another early means of recording time applied the principle
of the consumption of some slow-burning fuel by fire.
From remote ages, the Chinese and Japanese thus used
ropes, knotted at regular intervals, or cylinders of glue and
sawdust marked in rings, which slowly smoldered away.
Alfred the Great, that noble English king of the ninth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>century, is said to have invented the candle-clock, because
of a vow to give eight hours of the day to acts of religion,
eight hours to public affairs, and eight hours to rest and
recreation. He had six tapers made, each twelve inches
long and divided into twelve parts, or inches, colored
alternately black and white. Three of these parts were
burned in one hour, making each inch represent twenty
minutes, so that his six candles, lighted one after the other
by his chaplains, would burn for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The Eskimos also, through the long arctic night have
watched the lamp which gives both light and heat to their
cold huts of snow. But all these are no more than crude
conveniences, whose irregularity is evident, and there is
likewise no need to do more than call attention to the effect
upon fire in any form, of wind or dampness in the air.
The Roman lamp-clock sheltered from the weather was the
best of them all, and was the only one which long continued
in civilized use.</p>

<p>Our chief interest in all such devices comes from the
touch of poetry still remaining in the tradition of the sacred
flame which must be kept forever burning, and in
association of life and time with fire, in such parables as
that of the Wise and Foolish Virgins. There is a reminder
of this old time-keeping by fire in all that poetry and
philosophy which tells of hope that still may live or of
deeds that maybe done, "while the lamp holds out to burn."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus far, in spite of occasional glimpses of the Middle
Ages and of modern times, we have dealt, for the most
part, with earlier ages. Now our story must leave these
behind, and thus passes the ancient world with its strange
pagan civilization which was so human, so wise and so
simple. It is difficult for modern Americans even to imagine
existence in ancient Greece or Rome or in still more ancient
Egypt and Mesopotamia—since the whole attitude
toward life was so essentially different from what it is
to-day.</p>

<p>Our debt to the ancients in this one matter of recording
time is typical of that in many others. To them we owe our
whole fundamental system and conception of it from the
astronomy by which we measure our years and our seasons
and make our appeal to the final standard of the stars,
down to the arithmetic of our minutes and seconds and the
very names of our months and days.</p>

</div>

<p>In the modern application and practical use of all this,
on the other hand, we owe them nothing. They never made
a clock or watch, or any like device which has more than
a merely ornamental use to-day. They gave us the general
plan so well that we have never bettered it, but they left
later generations to work out the details. They invented
the second as a division of time but they did not measure
by it. They did not care to try. For them, learning was the
natural right and power of the few, and the gulf between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>the most that was known by the few and the little that was
known in general, was like the gulf between great wealth
and great poverty among ourselves.</p>

<p>Indeed, in this age of teaching and preaching, when a
thought seems to need only to be born in order to be spread
abroad over the world, it is hard for us even to conceive
the instinct by which men kept their learning like a secret
among the initiated and felt no impulse to make known
that which they knew.</p>

<p>Their great men thought and did wonderful things which
are now the common property of us all. And their common
folk lived in a fashion astonishingly primitive by comparison,
in an ignorance which certainly was weakness and may
somehow have been bliss.</p>

<p>That world of theirs is gone—the body and the spirit of
it alike. And there remains to us, along with much of their
art and their science, the hour-glass to symbolize that relentless
flight of time which they feared but never tried to
save; and the quaint sun-dial in our gardens, a memory of
that worldly-wise old philosophy which counted only the
shining hours.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX<br />

<small><i>The Clocks Which Named Themselves</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Now</span> the scene changes again, and the story
shifts forward over the interval of a thousand
years. As we take up the tale once more, we find
ourselves in another world, amid a life as different from
that ancient life of which we have been speaking as either
of them is from our own life to-day.</p>

<p>The ancient civilization, which may be traced from
Rome through Greece, Babylon and Egypt back to the
dim dawn of history, is gone almost as if it had never been.
For there came a period when great hordes of barbarians
defeated the armies, burnt the cities, pillaged and destroyed,
leaving only desolation and ruin behind them. Then
followed hundreds of years of what we call the "Dark
Ages,"—ages of ignorance and violence, when mankind
was slowly struggling upwards again and was forming a
new civilization upon the ruins of the old. Therefore, at
the point we have now reached, there are no more white
temples and pillared porticos and sandaled men in white
tunic and toga, and marble statues in green gardens; but
everywhere we find sharp roofs and towers, quaint outlines,
and wild color like a child's picture-book.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>There are castles with their moats and battlements, and
monasteries with their cloistered arches; there are knights
in armor riding, and lords and ladies gorgeous in strange
garments, and monks in their dull gowns, and the sturdy
peasant working in the field; and in the towns, all among
peaked gables and Gothic windows and rough cobbled
streets, a motley crowd of beggar and burgher and courtier,
priest and clerk, doctor and scholar and soldier and
merchant and tradesman—an endless variety of types,
and each in the distinctive costume of his calling. And
there are churches everywhere, from the huge cathedral
towering like a forest of carven stone to the humble village
chapel or wayside shrine, their spires all pointing up to
heaven in token of the change that has come upon the life
and spirit of the world.</p>

<p>We have come from the height of the classic period suddenly
into the heart of the Middle Ages; and in the dark
centuries that lie between, Christ and His Disciples have
come and gone, and the religion of the Western World has
changed; the old gods have perished and the saints have
filled their places. And Rome has died, and Romance has
been born.</p>

<p>The center of civilization has shifted to the north and
west; from the old ring of lands around the Mediterranean
to the great nations of modern Europe. Italy has become a
jealous group of independent cities, great in art and commerce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>but in little else. Germany is much the same, except
for the lack of some few score centuries of tradition. France
and Spain are already great and growing. William the
Conqueror has fought and ruled and died, and the "Merry
England" of song and story has grown up out of the fusion
of Saxon and Norman. Chivalry and the Crusades, the
times of <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> and <cite>The Talisman</cite>, are as fresh as yesterday.</p>

<p>And by green hedgerows and hospitable inns, Chaucer's
Pilgrims are plodding onward toward the sound of Canterbury's
bells. For here is the point of all our seeking—that
there are clocks now in the monasteries and in the Cathedral
towers. There is just one curious link of likeness
between the Middle Ages and the remoter past; as it was
at first at Babylon, so now in the fourteenth century the
priesthood holds almost a monopoly of science and of
learning.</p>

<p>Thus, although the sun-dial, clepsydra and sand-glass
are still much used, we find ourselves at last in the time and
lands of <em>clocks</em>. The very sound of the word "clock" gives a
clue to its origin. It suggests the striking of the hour upon
some bell. The French called the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cloche</i> and the Saxons
<i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">clugga</i>, and both of these originally meant a bell.</p>

<p>If you will put yourself back in the picture at the beginning
of the chapter, you will find yourself in a realm of
sounding, pealing, chiming bells with the hours of prayer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>throughout the day, from matins to angelus, rung out
from the belfries, and with frequent deep-toned strikings of
the hour. Not even a blind man could have remained unconscious
of the passage of the hours under such conditions,
and time, in a sense, became more a possession of
democracy although timepieces themselves were still the
mark of special privilege.</p>

<p>Life also was beginning to hurry just a little. Very deliberate,
we should call it in comparison with the mad rush
of the twentieth century, and yet it began to show its
growing complexity in that humanity was becoming more
definitely organized and men were forced to depend more
and more upon each other. In all of this, there was a
slightly growing sense of the things that were to be, just as
the water for some miles above Niagara begins to hasten
its course under the influence of the mighty cataract over
which it will at last go madly plunging.</p>

<p>Herein occurs another of those baffling questions, like
the old-time puzzler as to whether the hen first came from
the egg or the egg from the hen. One cannot help wondering
to what extent the increasing accuracy of the broadening
knowledge of time-keeping was the <em>result</em> of our complicated
modern life and to what extent it was the <em>cause</em>. Certainly
we cannot conceive of present-day affairs as being
conducted save in the light of moving hands and figures
upon a dial.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>From the Middle Ages, then, we get our word for clock
and, which is more important, we begin to get some crude
application of its modern mechanical principles. They were
wonderfully skilful, those medieval workmen, considering
the means at their disposal, and the ingenuity of some of
their clocks is still a delight, but, perhaps, for better understanding
of the story, we should stop for a minute to inquire
exactly what a clock means from the mechanical
point of view.</p>

<p>A clock is a machine for keeping time. And for this there
are four essentials, without any one of which there would
be no clock. First, there must be a motive power to make it
run; second, there must be a means of transmitting this
power; third, there must be a regulating device to make the
mechanism move steadily and slowly, and keep the motive
power from running down too quickly; and, fourth, there
must be some device to mark the time and make it known.</p>

<p>In a typical modern clock the power comes from the pull
of a weight or the pressure of a spring—although clocks
may, of course, be operated by electricity or compressed
air or some other means; also, the regulator is what is
known as the "escapement" and the recording device consists
of the hands, the dial, and the striking mechanism.
Having stated this, let us return to the past and see if we
can determine how these principles came to be applied.</p>

<p>This is not altogether easy. Our forefathers were less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>particular than we over such trifling questions as names
and spelling—even the learned Shakespeare, long afterward,
used several different spellings of his own name.
Thus, when we see in the records of the period the name of
"clock" or "horologe" we cannot tell with certainty what
type is meant, since "horologe" meant simply a device for
keeping time; it might have been applied equally well to a
clock, clepsydra, an hour-glass, or even a sun-dial.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible," writes M. Gubelin Breitschmidt,
the younger, an eminent horologist of Lucerne, Switzerland,
"that a large number of the technical inventions of
antiquity were lost during the migrations of the barbarians
and under the chaotic conditions prevailing during the first
thousand years of Christianity, but the most perfect surviving
instrument for measuring time was the water-clock,
known as the clepsydra, which was able to maintain its
supremacy long after the appearance of the wholly mechanical
clock, just as the beautiful manuscripts of the
artist monks and laymen were favored by the cultured
classes long after the invention of movable types for
printing.</p>

<p>"The spread of Christianity throughout Europe caused
the foundation of many religious communities, and the
severe rules by which they were governed—fixing the hours
of prayer, labor, and refreshment—forced their members
to seek instruments by which to measure time. In the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>605, a bull of Pope Sabinianus decreed that all bells be
rung seven times in the twenty-four hours, at fixed moments
and regularly, and these fixed times became known
as the seven canonical hours. The sound of the bells penetrated
and came to regulate not only the life of the religious
bodies but also that of the secular people who lived
outside the walls of the monasteries. Oil-lamps, candles,
hour-glasses, prayers and—for those who had the means of
buying them—clepsydr&aelig; served as chronometers for the
brotherhoods; so that one can easily imagine that many
a monk sought to improve these instruments. But as yet,
no one had found means to regulate the wheel-system of a
movement. In the best instruments of this period, water
supplied the motive power and served as well to regulate
the action."</p>

<p>There is a general belief that Gerbert, the monk, who
was the most accomplished scholar of his age, and who
later became Pope Sylvester <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, was the one who first took
the important step of producing a real clock, and that this
occurred near the close of the tenth century—or to be
more exact, about 990 A. D. This period was one of densest
superstition, and expectancy of the end of the world was in
the air, since many people had fixed upon the year 1000
A. D. as the date of that cataclysmic event.</p>

<p>Authorities of the Church and of the state were not very
partial to invention and research, their attention being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>fixed largely upon theological, political, or military affairs;
but, of course, inquiring and constructive minds were still
to be found; even without encouragement these tended to
follow the impulse of their natures.</p>

<p><i>As a youth of seventeen Galileo watched a swinging lamp,

</div>

<p>It is to the monks in their cloisters that we chiefly owe the
preservation of learning through the "dark ages," and from
the monks, for the most part, came such progress of science
and invention as was made. If Gerbert, the monk, after
patient tinkering with wheels and weights in his stone-walled
workshop, really achieved some form of the clock-action
as we know it, he was one of the great benefactors of
the human race. Still, it is not impossible that his device
may only have been a more remarkable application of the
clepsydra principle.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it seems to have startled the authorities,
for they are said to have accused him of having practiced
sorcery through league with the devil, and to have
banished him for a time from France. His age appears to
have had a vast respect for the intellectual powers of his
Satanic Majesty. Anything which was too ingenious or
scientific to be understood without an uncomfortable degree
of mental application was very apt to be ascribed to
diabolic inspiration and thus found unfit for use in "Christian"
lands. It could hardly have been a stimulating atmosphere
for would-be inventors.</p>

<p>All of the credit that we are ascribing to Gerbert must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>therefore be prefixed with an "if." Did he really invent the
clock-movements, or is this merely another of the tales
which have blown down to us from this age of tradition and
romance? For similar tales are told of Pacificus in 849 A. D.
of the early Pope Sabinianus in 612 and even of Boetheus,
the philosopher, as far back as 510 A. D., while always in
the background are claims of priority for the Chinese who
are supposed to have discovered many of our most important
mechanical and scientific principles away off upon
the other side of the world before these were dreamed of in
the west.</p>

<p>If all of these various claims were true, which is far from
likely, it still would not need to surprise us, for it must be
remembered that humanity, until within the past few
generations, was more or less a collection of separated units
and its records were very incomplete. There was scant interest
in abstract research and very limited intercourse
between towns and countries; one who made an important
discovery in one locality might be unheard of a hundred
miles away. Unless all the conditions were favorable, his
ideas might even pass from memory with his death, until
some scholar of modern times might chance upon their
record.</p>

<p>All that can with certainty be said, therefore, is that
there were clocks of some sort in the monasteries during
the eleventh century; that back of these were the clepsydr&aelig;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>and other time recording devices; and that here and
there through the preceding centuries are more or less believable
tales of inventions that had to do with the subject.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered, too, that some of the brilliant
minds of ancient times made discoveries that were forgotten
after the barbarian waves overwhelmed preceding
civilizations. The ages following the downfall of Rome
were those of intellectual darkness, illiteracy, and rude
force until mankind groped slowly back toward the light
through the process of <em>rediscovery</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, it mattered not at all to the medieval world that
Archimedes, the great Greek scientist and engineer—who,
however, chanced to live in the Greek colony of Sicily—was
able, somewhere about 200 B. C., to construct a system
of revolving spheres which reproduced the motion of the
heavenly bodies. Such a machine must necessarily have
involved some sort of clock-work. We dare not stop to
consider Archimedes, lest we stray too far from our subject,
but this marvelous man of ancient times, the Benjamin
Franklin of his day, seems to have had a hand in
almost every sort of mechanical and scientific research,
from discovering the principle of specific gravity, in order
to checkmate a dishonest goldsmith, to destroying Roman
war-ships by means of his scientific "engines." The story
is told that he set the ships on fire by concentrating upon
them the rays of the sun from a number of concave mirrors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>And, although this story may not be true, the things
that he is known to have done are extraordinary.</p>

<p>Archimedes and his knowledge had long passed away
when the monastery clocks of the eleventh century began
to sound the hour. These were the fruit of a crude new
civilization just struggling for expression, and represented
the general period when William the Conqueror led his
Norman army into England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN<br />

<small><i>The Modern Clock and Its Creators</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">We</span> learn that toward the close of the thirteenth
century a clock was set up in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's
Cathedral in London (1286); one in Westminster,
by 1288; and one in Canterbury Cathedral, by
1292. The Westminster clock and the chime of bells were
put up from funds raised by a fine imposed on a chief
justice who had offended the government. The clock
bore as an inscription the words of Virgil: "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Discite
justitiam moniti</i>," "Learn justice from my advice," and
the bells were gambled away by Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>! In the same
century, Dante, whose wonderful poem the <cite>Commedia</cite>,
(the <cite>Inferno</cite>, <cite>Purgatory</cite> and <cite>Paradise</cite>) is sometimes called
the "Swan Song of the Middle Ages," since it marks the
passing of the medieval times, spoke of "wheels that
wound their circle in an orloge."</p>

<p>Chaucer speaks of a cock crowing as regularly "as a
<em>clock</em> in an abbey orloge." And this shows, curiously, the
early meaning of the word, for by the word "clock,"
Chaucer evidently meant the <em>bell</em> which struck the hour,
and, very obviously, he used the word "orloge" to indicate
the clock itself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>Many of these "clocks" had neither dials nor hands. They
told time only by striking the hour. Sometimes in the great
tower clocks there were placed automatic figures representing
men in armor or even mere grotesque figures which,
at the right moment, beat upon the bell. These figures were
called "jacks o' the clock" or "jacquemarts" and curious
specimens of them are still in existence.</p>

<p>The early abbey clocks did not even strike the hour but
rang an alarm to awaken the monks for prayers. Here
again, the alarm principle precedes the visible measurement
of time; even now, as already noted, we speak of a
"clock" by the old word for "bell."</p>

<p>In the course of the following century—the fourteenth—clocks
began to appear which were really worthy of the
name, and of these we have authentic details. They were to
be found in many lands. One of them was built, in 1344, by
Giacomo Dondi at Padua, Italy. Another was constructed
in England, in 1340, by Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury.
And in 1364, Henry de Wieck, De Wyck, or de
Vick, of Wurtemburg, was sent for by Charles <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr>, King of
France, to come to Paris and build a clock for the tower of
the royal palace, which is now the Palais de Justice. It was
finished and set up in February 1379, and there it still remains
after lapse of five and a half centuries, although its
present architectural surroundings were not finished until
a much later date.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>This venerable timepiece termed by some chroniclers
"the parent of modern timekeepers," was still performing
its duty as late as 1850. And so it is a matter of interesting
record that its mechanism, which served to measure the
passage of time in the days when the earth was generally
believed to be flat and when the Eastern Division of the
Roman Empire was still ruled from Byzantium, now
Constantinople, has served the same purpose within the
possible memory of men now living. Its bell has one grim
association—it gave the signal for that frightful piece of
Medicean treachery, the Massacre of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew,
planned by Catherine de Medici, the mother of the King
Charles <abbr title="the ninth">IX</abbr>, when the armed retainers of the crown of
France flung themselves upon the unsuspecting Huguenots
and caused the streets to run red with the blood of
men, women and children—a ghastly butchery of thousands
of people.</p>

<p>As we have seen, de Vick's clock was neither the earliest
made, nor among the earliest; nor, probably, did it embody
any at that time new mechanical invention. It does,
however, fairly and clearly typify the oldest style of clock
of which we to-day have any accurate knowledge. Compare
its description, then, with the clock upon your shelf.</p>

<p>We think of the tall-cased "grandfather's clocks" as
antique; but this tower-clock of de Vick's outdoes them in
antiquity by some four hundred years. And its most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>feature is its curious likeness in mechanical principle
to the clocks of modern times. Like most early clocks,
it has only one hand—the hour-hand. Its ponderous movement
is of iron, laboriously hand-wrought; the teeth of its
wheels and pinions were cut out one by one. It was driven
by a weight of five hundred pounds, the cord of which was
wound round a drum, or barrel. This barrel carried, at one
end, a pinion, meshing with the hour-wheel, which drove
the hands; the flange at the other end of the barrel formed
the great wheel, or first wheel of the train. This meshed
with a pinion on the shaft of the second wheel, and this in
turn with a lantern-pinion upon the shaft of the escape-wheel.
All of this is, of course, essentially the modern train
of gears, only with fewer wheels.</p>

<p>The escapement is the most important part of the whole
mechanism, because it is the part which makes the clock
keep time. It is an <em>interrupter</em>, checking the movement almost
as soon as, under the urge of the mainspring, it starts
forward. The frequency and duration of these interruptions
determines the rate of running. Without this, the movement
would run down swiftly; with it, the operation
stretches over thirty hours, involving 432,000 <em>interruptions</em>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Time Piece of the Middle Ages</span></p>

<p><i>The huge and elaborate Clock of Strasbourg Cathedral, in
Lorraine, was built in 1352 and is an example of the first clocks.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>De Vick's escapement is shown in the illustration. The
escape-wheel was bent into the shape of a shallow pan, so
that its toothed edge was at a right angle to the flat part
of the wheel. Near it was placed a verge, or rotating shaft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>so called from a Latin word meaning "turning around."
On this verge were fastened two flat projections called
<em>pallets</em>, diverging from each other at about an angle of one
hundred degrees. The width between the pallets, from
center to center of each, was equal to the diameter of the
wheel, so that one would mesh with the teeth at the top of
the escape-wheel and the other with the teeth at the
bottom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_081"></a>
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="400" height="399" alt="de Vick's Clock" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><i>de Vick's Clock</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Now, if the upper pallet were between the teeth at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>top of the wheel, the pressure of the wheel trying to turn
would push it away until the teeth were set free. But, in so
doing, it would cause the verge to turn and bring the lower
pallet between the teeth at the bottom of the wheel. And
since the bottom of the wheel was, of course, traveling in
the opposite direction from the top, the action would be
reversed, and the lower pallet would be pushed away,
bringing the upper one back between the teeth of the wheel
again; and so on, "tick-tock," the wheel moving a little
way each time, and the pallets alternately catching and
holding it from going too far.</p>

<p>The device was kept running slowly by means of a cross-bar
called a "foliot," fastened across the top of the verge in
the shape of a T, and having weights on its two ends.
When this weighted bar was set turning in one direction, it
would, of course, resist being suddenly stopped and started
turning the other way, as it was constantly made to do.
And this furnished the regulating action which retarded
the motion of the works and kept them from running
down.</p>

<p>This involves the principle of the modern balance-wheel
in both watches and clocks, which is that of <em>inertia</em>; the rim
of the balance-wheel represents the weights on the bar
that resist the pull of the pallets. A vital improvement,
however, is the interception of the hair spring which gives
elasticity to the pull and thus supplies the elements of precision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>and refinement. The inertia of the balance-wheel is
gauged by the weight of the rim and its distance from the
center; and the last refinement of regulation of the mechanism
is produced by moving the tiny screws on the periphery
of this wheel outward or inward.</p>

<p>We shall see later how this old escapement was in principle
much like the improved forms in use to-day. It was
as quaint and clumsy an affair as the first automobile or
the first steam-engine. But, like them, it was a great invention,
destined to achieve great results. For it was the means
of <em>making a machine keep time</em>. And every clock and watch
in use to-day depends for its usefulness upon a similar
device. The tick is the first thing we think of in connection
with a clock; and it is the most essential thing also,
<em>because it is the escapement which does the ticking</em>.</p>

<p>This old clock of de Vick's also struck the hours upon a
bell and in very much the same way as modern clocks are
made to do. But the mechanical means by which it did so
are too complicated to be easily described here. And indeed
it is unnecessary to do so, since the bell is far less important.
A clock need not strike, but it must keep time.</p>

<p>On the fearsome eve of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew, therefore, and
<em>again within the past generation</em>, the clanging of this old
clock's bell was brought about by the whirling gears and
ponderous weights of an early craftsman who wrought his
work into the ages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>As already stated, de Vick's mechanism embodied
mechanical principles which, although greatly developed
and improved, are employed even at the present day. All
the essentials of a clock are there; the motive power—the
descent of a massive weight—is now replaced by a slender
spring; the train of gears by which this motion is reduced
and communicated, are cut to-day with the extreme accuracy
of modern machine work; the hand moving around
the dial is now accompanied by a longer, swifter hand to
tell the minutes; the escapement which by checking the
motive power while yet allowing it to move on step by step,
retards and regulates—even the numbered striking of the
unchanging hours.</p>

<p>De Vick's old clock may have been a crude machine—it
certainly was a poor timekeeper—but it was the sturdy
ancestor of all those myriad tribes of clocks and watches
which warn us solemnly from our towers, chime to us from
our mantels, or, nestling snugly in our pockets, or clinging
to our wrists, help us to maintain our efficiency in the complexities
of modern life. The mechanism employed by de
Vick was retained without any improvement of importance
in all the time-pieces of the next three hundred years.
The foliot escapement, especially, remained in use much
longer. Indeed, any modern watchmaker would recognize
that it was practically a horizontal balance-wheel.</p>

<p>Long before it was improved upon, watches had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>invented and clocks had everywhere become common. But
we shall reserve the watch for the next chapter; for the
moment, our concern is with clocks alone.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of the medieval clock was its inaccuracy.
This was due first to crude workmanship and unnecessary
friction; but that trouble was presently overcome,
for the medieval mechanic could be as fine and accurate
a workman as any modern. He had the artist's
personal pride and pleasure in his skill, and also a great
unhurried patience, somewhat hard for us to picture in
this breathless age. At best, however, his work fell far
short of the accuracy possible with modern machinery.
Other important difficulties were found in the expansion
and contraction of parts due to temperature variations, and
the fact that the foliot balance was at its best only when
running slowly. Altogether, then, these early clocks were
easily surpassed in accuracy of timekeeping by a sun-dial
or a good clepsydra.</p>

<p>The question arises, therefore, why this newcomer in
the field of timekeeping, should have begun to displace the
earlier devices. The clock was not yet a better timepiece
than the sun-dial; why did it grow more common? Well,
for one thing, people like novelties. For another, people
loved their churches and lived by the chimes of distant
bells; and the clock was by far the most practical striking
device, whatever might be its faults in keeping time. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>what was most important of all, it was a machine, susceptible
of infinite improvement and offering a field for endless
ingenuity. It appealed to that inborn mechanical instinct
by means of which mankind has wrought his mastery over
the world.</p>

<p>We have seen how de Vick's clock contained, as it were,
the germ of all our clocks. And, moreover, the medieval
regarded machinery with profoundest awe. It is the unknown
which awakes imagination. <em>We</em> wonder at the
cathedrals of his day, but the medieval knew about cathedrals;
he built them. Considering their comparatively
cruder tools, lack of modern hoisting machinery, and so
forth, their architectural and building abilities exceeded
even those of to-day. On the other hand, a locomotive or
a modern watch, such as we glance at without special
notice, would have appeared to him the product of sheer
sorcery, too wonderful to be the work of human hands.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages could not much improve their clock
without some radical invention; and such a mechanical
type of invention was yet the province of but few minds.
The typical craftsman could merely make the clock more
convenient, more decorative, and more wonderful. To this
work, he and his fellows addressed themselves with all of
their patient skill and their endless ingenuity for ornamentation.</p>

<p>They made clocks for their churches and public buildings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>and elaborated them with intricate mechanical devices.
The old "Jacks" that struck the bells were only a
beginning. They made clocks for their kings and wealthy
nobles, adorning them with all the richness that an artist
could design and a skilful jeweler execute. They made
clocks even for ordinary domestic use so quaint in design
and so clever in workmanship that we exhibit them to-day
in our museums. One difficulty in determining the date of
the first invention is that long before the days of de Vick
and Lightfoot, machines were made to show the day of the
week and month and to imitate the movements of the
stars; and the first horological records may refer to clock-works
of this kind.</p>

<p>The famous clock of Strassburg Cathedral shows the
extreme to which the medieval craftsman carried this kind
of ingenuity. It was originally put up in 1352 and has been
twice rebuilt, each time with greater elaboration. It is three
stories high and stands against the wall somewhat in the
shape of a great altar with three towers. Among its movements
are a celestial globe showing the positions of the sun,
moon, and stars, a perpetual calendar, a device for predicting
eclipses and a procession of figures representing the
pagan gods from whom the days of the week are named.
There are devices for showing the age and phases of the
moon and other astronomical events. The hours are struck
by a succession of automatic figures, and at the stroke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>noon a cock, perched upon one of the towers, flaps his
wings, ruffles his neck, and crows three times. This clock
still remains, having last been rebuilt in the four years 1838
to 1842. But its chief interest is that of a mechanical curiosity.
It keeps no better time than a common alarm-clock,
nor ever did. And in beauty as well as usefulness, it has
been surpassed many times by later and simpler structures.</p>

<p>For the first really important improvement in clock
making we must pass to the latter end of the sixteenth
century. The Italian Renaissance with its great impulse to
art and science has come and gone, and the march of events
has brought us well into the modern world. America had
been discovered a century and is beginning to be colonized.
Spain is trying to found a world empire upon blood and
gold and the tortures of the Inquisition. England is at the
height of the great Elizabethan period. It is the time of
Drake and Shakespeare and Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>At this period of intellectual awakening, a remarkable
young man steps upon the scene. In 1564, the year in which
the wonderful Englishman, Shakespeare, first saw the
light of day, the scarcely less wonderful Italian, Galileo, was
born in Pisa. He was gifted with keen eyes and a swift,
logical mind, which left its impress upon so many subjects
of human thought and speculation that we are tempted to
stop as with Archimedes and trace his history. But, one
single incident must suffice.</p>

<p>In 1581, this youth of seventeen stood in the cathedral
of Pisa. Close at hand, a lamp suspended by a long chain
swung lazily in the air currents. There was nothing unusual
in such a sight. Millions of other eyes had seen other suspended
objects going through exactly this motion and had
not given the sight a second thought. At this moment,
however, a great discovery of far-reaching application—one
which was to revolutionize clock construction—hung
waiting in the air. Young Galileo took notice.</p>

<p>The lamp swung to and fro, to and fro. Sometimes it
moved but slightly. Again, as a stronger breeze blew
through the great drafty structure, it swung in a considerable
arc, but always—and this was the point which impressed
itself upon the Italian lad—the swing was accomplished
in exactly the same time. When it moved a
short distance, it moved slowly; the farther it moved, the
faster became the motion; in its arc it moved more swiftly,
accomplishing the long swing in the same time as it did the
short one. In order to make sure of this fact, Galileo is said
to have timed the swinging lamp by counting the beating
of his pulse.</p>

<p>Thus was discovered the principle of the pendulum and
its "isochronism." By "isochronism" we mean <em>inequal arcs
in equal time</em>. In other words, any swinging body, such as a
pendulum, is said to be "isochronous" when it describes
long or short arcs in equal lengths of time. This also applies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>to a balance-wheel, and hair-spring. And herein lies a remarkable
fact—this epoch-making discovery was after all
but a rediscovery. The isochronism of a swinging body was
known in Babylon thousands of years before, although the
Babylonians, of course, could not explain it. Lacking in
application, it had passed from the minds of men, and it
remained for Galileo to observe the long-forgotten fact and
to work out its mechanical application. He did not himself
apply this principle to clock-making, although some fifty
years later, toward the end of his life, he did suggest such
an application.</p>

<p>The first pendulum clocks were probably made about
1665, by Christian Huyghens, the celebrated Dutch astronomer
and mathematician who discovered the rings of
Saturn; and by the English inventor, Doctor Robert
Hooke. The invention is claimed for several other men in
England and abroad at about the same time; but hardly
upon sufficient authority.</p>

<p>From that time on, the important improvements of
clockwork were chiefly made in two directions—those of
the mechanical perfection of the escapement and the compensation
for changes of temperature.</p>

<p>There is a little world of invention and discovery behind
the face of the clock which beats so steadily on your mantel.
Look within if you will, and see the compact mechanism
with its toothed gears, its coiled spring, or its swinging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>pendulum, in which the motion of the cathedral lamp is
harnessed for your service,—nothing in that grouping has
merely happened so. You may or may not understand all
the action of its parts, or the technical names of them; but
each feature in the structure has been the result of study
and experiment, as when Huyghens hung the pendulum
from a separate point and connected it with a forked crank
astride the pendulum shaft. You can see that forked crank
to this day, if you care to look; it was the product of good
Dutch brains.</p>

<p>Next we come to one of the greatest single improvements
in clock-work, and the chief difference between the
mechanism made by de Vick and the better ones of our own
time. When the pallets in a clock are forced by an increased
swing of the pendulum or by the form of the pallet faces
against the teeth of the escape-wheel in the direction opposite
to that in which the wheel is moving, the wheel must
be pushed backward a little way each time, and the whole
clock action is made to back up a little. You can see that
this would tend to interfere with good and regular timekeeping.
George Graham, in London, in 1690 corrected this
error by inventing the <em>dead-beat escapement</em> which rather
contradicted its name by working very well and faithfully.</p>

<p>There are many forms of this escapement and there is no
need to explain it in detail. But the main idea is this: At the
end of each vibration or swing of the pendulum, the escape-teeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>instead of being made to recoil by the downward
motion of the pallets, simply remains stationary or at rest
until the commencement of the return swing of the pendulum.
This was brought about by applying certain curves to
the acting faces of the pallets. But the acting faces of both
tooth and pallet are beveled, so that the tooth in slipping
by gives the pallet a "kick" or impulse outward and keeps
it in motion. Nowadays, even a common alarm-clock has
an escapement working in this way.</p>

<p>Then came another remarkably interesting contribution.
Have you ever wondered why the pendulums of fine
clocks were weighted with a <em>gridiron</em> of alternate rods of
brass and steel? For purpose of ornament? Not at all—it
constitutes a scientific solution of an embarrasing problem,
due to the inevitable variations in temperature. Metals expand
with heat and contract with cold. Notched iron bars
can be made to "crawl" along a flat surface by alternately
heating and cooling them. Bridge-builders sometimes
arrange sliding points, or rocking points to adjust the differences
in the length of the steel. Contraction and expansion
are important factors in all their calculations. But a
pendulum would change its rate of motion if it changed its
length and this would interfere with its accuracy as a measurer
of time. Graham worked upon this problem, too, and
attached a jar of mercury to the rod of his pendulum for a
weight. When the heat lengthened the rod, it also caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>the mercury to rise, just as in a thermometer, and this
left the "working-length" the same.</p>

<p>Such mercury-weighted pendulums are not uncommon
to this day, but the more familiar <em>gridiron</em> came from
the brain of John Harrison, who, in 1726, fixed the alternate
rods in such a way that the expanding brass rods
raised the weight as much as the expanding steel rods
lowered it. Thus they neutralized each other.</p>

<p>The clock as we know it was now virtually complete.
There were structural refinements, but no more radical
improvements to be made. In tracing its development from
the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, we note one
curious likeness to the ancient history of recorded time. In
this case, as before in Babylon, the people first concerned
with the science were the priests, and after them the
astronomers, but we note a still more important difference.</p>

<p>As the medieval passed into the modern, the practise of
horology passed more and more out of the hands of scientists
into the keeping of commercial workmen. The custodian
of time was at first a priest, and finally a manufacturer.
And this change was attended by a vast increase in
the general use of timepieces, and the correspondingly
greater influence of time upon society and men's way of
living. The Middle Ages made clocks and watches; and
clocks and watches make the age in which we live.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT<br />

<small><i>The Watch that Was Hatched from the
"Nuremburg Egg"</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the second act of Shakespeare's play, <cite>As You
Like It</cite>, when Touchstone, the fool, meets Jaques, the
sage, he draws forth a sun-dial from his pocket and
begins to moralize upon Time.</p>

<p>Touchstone's dial must have looked like a napkin-ring,
with a stem like that of a watch, by which to hold it up
edgewise toward the sun, and a tiny hole in the upper part
of the ring through which a little sunbeam could fall upon
the inner surface whereon the hours were marked. This
pinhole was perhaps pierced through a slide, which could
be adjusted up or down according to the sun's position at
the time of year. In principle, therefore, it was a miniature
of the huge dial of Ahaz of more than two thousand years
before.</p>

<p>In another Shakespeare play, <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, Malvolio is
gloating in imagination over his coming luxury when he
shall have married the heiress and entered upon a life of
wealth and leisure.</p>

<p>"I frown the while," says he; "and perchance wind up
my watch, or play with my—some rich jewel."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>There, in those two quotations, we have the whole
meaning of the watch in the time of Queen Elizabeth.
Touchstone's dial was a practical convenience—a thing to
tell the time. Malvolio's watch was a piece of jewelry, an
ornament indicating wealth and splendor. While watches
had been well known for many years, people wore them
chiefly for display and told time by means of pocket sun-dials.</p>

<p>For the first watches we must go back to about the year
1500, shortly after America had been discovered, and
when the great tower-clocks of de Vick and Lightfoot were
not much more than a century old. In the quaint old town
of Nuremberg there lived, at that time, one Peter Henlein,
probably a locksmith. But a locksmith, in those days,
would be an expert mechanic—more like a modern toolmaker;
very likely an armorer also; capable of that fine
workmanship in metal which we still wonder at in our
museums. Nuremberg was then very much a medieval
city, all red-tiled roofs and queer windows, where people
went about dressed in trunks and jerkins and pointed caps
and pointed shoes. It looked like <cite>Die Meistersinger</cite>, and
<cite>Grimm's Fairy Tales</cite>, and pictures by Howard Pyle and
Maxfield Parrish; very much like "Spotless Town," except
that it was far from spotless.</p>

<p>Now, as you remember, there was not until long after
this any means of making clocks keep anything like accurate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>time; so, instead of improving them, people competed
with each other in devising novel and ingenious
forms. There could be no more desirable novelty than a
clock small enough to stand upon a desk or table, or even
to be carried around. Such a clock could not well be driven
by weights. But Peter Henlein overcame that difficulty by
using for the motive power a coiled mainspring wound up
with a ratchet, just as we still do to-day.</p>

<p>There is some dispute over attributing to Henlein the
credit for this invention; but at least he did the thing, and
it cannot be proved that anybody did it before him.
"Every day," wrote Johannes Coeuleus, in 1511, "produces
more ingenious inventions. A clever and comparatively
young man—Peter Henlein—creates works that are
the admiration of leading mathematicians, for, out of a
little iron he constructs clocks with numerous wheels,
which, without any impulse and in any position, indicate
time for forty hours and strike, and which can be carried
in the purse as well as in the pocket."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The First Pocket Time Piece</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>In Shakespear's play, "As You Like It," Touchstone, the
Fool, draws forth a pocket sun dial, which probably was of the
"napkin ring" type.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>There was, however, no invention of any such thing as
we mean by the term <em>watch</em> to-day that came complete
from the mind of any one man, but the contrivance
gradually grew, in shape and structure out of the small
clock which could be worn at the belt or on a chain round
the neck. It came to be called a <em>watch</em> because <em>clock</em> meant
a bell that struck the hours. But many of the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>watches had striking apparatus, and this circumstance
added to the confusion of names. We slangily call a fat,
old-fashioned watch a <em>turnip</em>; but the first watches were
very much fatter and more old-fashioned, and might
fairly have deserved the name. Before long, Henlein was
making them oval in shape. Hence, they were called
<em>Nuremberg eggs</em>.</p>

<p>Here, then, is something which we can really consider a
watch. Let us see how it compares with those that we
know to-day. In the first place, being egg-shaped, it was
thick and heavy—you would not like to carry it in your
pocket. It had no crystal and only one hand—the hour-hand.
So much for the outside.</p>

<p>Inside, the difference was still greater. The works were
made of iron and put together with pins and rivets. It was
all hand-work—expert workmanship, indeed—but look at
the works of your own watch and try to imagine cutting
the teeth in those tiny gears, or making those delicate
springs with files and hammers. As pieces of hand-workmanship,
therefore, the watches made by Henlein and his
followers were remarkable; but when compared with our
modern watches, they were crude and clumsy affairs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they were poor timekeepers. They had the
old foliot balance running parallel to the dial. This was all
very well as long as the watch lay on the table with the
balance swinging horizontally. But as soon as it was carried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>in a perpendicular position, the arms of the balance
had to swing up and down, which was quite another matter.
And then, of course, the crudeness of the works produced
a great deal of friction. This made it necessary to use
a very stiff mainspring, otherwise the watch would not run
at all. Such a spring exercised more pressure when fully
wound than when it was nearly run down. And so the
worst fault of the foliot was that it speeded up under increased
pressure.</p>

<p>The first improvements, and, in fact, the only ones for
nearly two hundred years, were directed toward doing
away with the unequal pressure of the mainspring and
thus make the watch keep better time. If you look into the
back of a very early watch, you may see a curious device
consisting of a curved arm ending in a pinion, which travels
round an eccentric gear of peculiar shape. This is the
first type of equalizing mechanism; it was invented in
Peter Henlein's time and was called the <em>stackfreed</em>; but it
was a clumsy device at best and a great waste of power.
Therefore it was gradually displaced by the <em>fusee</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps one might have felt a certain amount of pride
in carrying about such a thick, bulging mechanical toy,
as were these early watches, but, as to possessing something
that would keep correct time—that was a different
matter. After admiring it and listening to its ticking, one
would have to guess as to just how far wrong it might be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>People did not figure closely on minutes and half minutes
in the day of the <em>Nuremberg egg</em>; there was no "Wall
Street" and no commuting. And this brings us to a real
event in the whole story.</p>

<p>Jacob Zech, a Swiss mechanic, living at Prague in
Bohemia, Austria, about 1525, began studying the problem
of the equalization of watch mechanism. He was sure
that there ought to be some better means than that of the
clumsy stackfreed. Presently he hit upon the principle of
the fusee, and Gruet, another Swiss, perfected it. At last it
became possible to make a watch that would not run fast
when first wound and then go more and more slowly as it
ran down—and to do this in a really practical way. Before
this time, a watch was a clumsy piece of ticking jewelry;
now it became something of a real time-keeper. Therefore,
it was not long before people began to want Swiss watches.
These were the days when skilful Swiss craftsmen worked
patiently in their little home shops, making some single
watch-part and making it extremely well, while the so-called
"manufacturer" bought up these separate parts, and
assembled them into watches.</p>

<p>What was the fusee that brought about such a change?
Not much to look at, surely—merely a short cone with a
spiral groove running about it, and a cord, or chain,
wound in this groove and fastened at the large end of the
core. Its principle and its action were very simple, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>is why it was a great invention. Some one has said that
anyone can invent a complicated machine to do a piece of
work, but it takes real brains to make a <em>simple</em> machine
<em>that will do the same work</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_100"></a>
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="400" height="184" alt="Stackfreed, Mainspring Barrel and Fusee" />
</div>

<p>The shaft of the fusee was attached to the great wheel
which drove the gears, and the other end of the cord was
fastened to the mainspring barrel. This is the way in which
it worked: The mainspring slowly turned the barrel; this
gradually unwound the cord from the fusee and caused the
fusee to turn. When the fusee turned, the wheels also were
forced to turn, and the watch was running. At the start,
the cord would unwind from the small end where the leverage
was least, but as the tension of the mainspring grew
slowly less, the leverage of the cord grew slowly greater
and, consequently, the power applied to the wheels was
always of the same degree of strength. This invention gave
a great impulse to Swiss watchmaking; several centuries
later it worked to the disadvantage of English manufacturers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>for they continued to use it after other countries
had found still better methods of power equalization.</p>

<p>The fusee was invented about the year 1525, at a time
when the world was fairly alive with new ideas. People in
Europe were just beginning to realize that they were living
on a sphere and not upon a flat surface, and that there was
a vast new land on the other side of the ocean. Columbus
had crossed the Atlantic but a few years before and now
explorers were making new voyages of discovery in every
direction.</p>

<p>Printing, invented by Gutenberg, about a century before,
was becoming common enough to be a real power in
the world, bringing the thoughts of men before the eyes of
thousands without the slow and expensive process of hand-copying.
The first printed copy of the Bible had made its
appearance and Caxton had set up his first printing-press—all
within the lifetime of people then living—and printing
shops were being established in many places. Many
people were learning to read—a thing that could be said
of very few in the Middle Ages. They were finding out
something about the wonderful forgotten civilization of
ancient times. Everywhere people's minds were stirring.
We call it the time of the <em>Renaissance</em>, or the <em>rebirth</em> of
civilization, but in some respects it was more like the
awakening of the world after a long sleep. Just as a person
on waking looks first at his clock or watch, so now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>world, preparing to be busy and modern, needed some
better means of telling time. It therefore was both natural
and necessary that the watch should have received such a
great improvement as the fusee at just this period.</p>

<p>Then began the age of those strange, ingenious watches
which we still find in the museums. For some time, there
were only a few real improvements. Screws and brass
wheels were introduced into their construction about 1550,
and glass crystals about 1600. The minute-hand appeared
occasionally; but it was not in common use for nearly a
century afterward. And that shows how watches were regarded
in those days. One would think that such an obvious
advantage as that of minute-notation would have
been seized upon and utilized at once; on the contrary,
people did not seem to care much about it. What was the
use of a hand to mark the minutes, when the watch was
more likely than not to be half an hour or so in error?</p>

<p>For real timekeeping there were dials everywhere, and
there were also fairly good clocks in the towers; at night,
watchmen patrolled the streets and called out the hours.
These watchmen were the police of the period; it was part
of their duty to call out the time, just as the modern police
direct people upon the way they wish to go. For timekeeping,
the watch was still less useful than the watchman.
Made entirely by hand, it was necessarily expensive;
therefore, it was made regardless of expense. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>thought of as Malvolio thought of it—a possession showing
the wealth and station of the wearer, a rich jewel, a toy for
noblemen and for kings. Centuries were to pass before real
watches were within the reach of common people.</p>

<p>It is said that Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI</abbr> was the first Englishman to
possess a watch. This young king, who reigned so short
a time, will be remembered by many as the young prince
in Mark Twain's famous story <cite>The Prince and the Pauper</cite>.
Mary Queen of Scots had a small watch shaped like
a skull—a cheerful fashion of the time. Many others were
shaped in the form of insects, flowers, animals, and various
other objects. Even to-day the Swiss make many watches
of curious form.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth and her court selected watches as
modern women do their hats—to match their various costumes.
These watches were usually worn on a chain or
ribbon round the neck and were largely for display. Several
outside cases were often supplied with watches of that
period, and they were made to fit on over that which held
the works; these were variously ornamented with jewels,
tortoise-shell and intricate pierced work in gold, almost as
delicate as lace. The covers were decorated with miniature
paintings, some of which were very beautiful.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it was this practise of decorating
watches that later gave us our plain white enameled dials,
because enamel was the best material on which to paint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>delicately. To the average museum visitor, the interest in
any collection of old watches, aside from their historic association,
lies in their marvelously ornamented cases rather
than in their mechanism. And in this he very closely repeats
the feeling of their original makers or owners; it was
more important to follow fashion than to know the time.</p>

<p>This custom of watch-decoration continued more or less
through the eighteenth century, and even into the nineteenth,
although, by that time, watches had, as we shall
see, become excellent timepieces. The story is told that
when Dresden was captured by the Prussians in 1757, they
found in the wardrobe of Count Bruhl, the Saxon Minister,
a different suit of clothes for every day in the year; each
had a watch, stick, and snuff-box, appropriately decorated,
as part of each one.</p>

<p>Shakespeare never regarded a watch seriously. In <cite>Love's
Labour's Lost</cite> he compares a woman to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="verse"><i>And never going aright, being a watch—</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A century after Shakespeare's day, Doctor Johnson remarked
that a dictionary was like a watch: "The worst is
better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go
quite true." And Pope says in the same vein:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>All of this reminds one of Dickens' famous character,
Cap'n Cuttle, whose watch was evidently of the old school.
Readers of <cite>Dombey and Son</cite> may remember how "the
Captain drew Walter into a corner, and with a great effort,
that made his face very red, pulled up the silver watch,
which was so big and so tight in his pocket that it came out
like a bung. "Wal'r," said the Captain, handing it over and
shaking him heartily by the hand, "a parting gift, my lad.
Put it back half an hour every morning and another quarter
toward afternoon and it's a watch that'll do you
credit.""</p>

<p>The old idea of regarding the watch as a trinket rather
than as a timepiece, as an expensive toy rather than as an
accurate and necessary mechanism, has come down to us
from the days when a watch was ornamented outside, because
it could not be really useful within. Even now, in
spite of the modern demand for accurate timekeeping, that
attitude has not entirely died away, as is shown by the
expression "gold watch" and "silver watch." Of course,
there are really no such things; there are merely gold and
silver <em>cases</em> for <em>steel</em>, <em>brass</em> and <em>nickel</em> watches. Some people
still continue this mistaken idea by thinking of a watch
merely as jewelry, as a thing meant more for ornament
than for use.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINE<br />

<small><i>How a Mechanical Toy Became a
Scientific Timepiece</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, since we are at last well into the story of the
watch, let us glance back over the road we have
traveled. We have seen man first beginning to
think of time by noting the positions of shadows or the
motions of the stars. Next, we have seen him making his
plans for days ahead by means of the changes in the moon,
then by making such division in the flow of time as the
month, the season, and the year. We have seen him growing
out of his savage isolated life in caves and forests and
forming tribes and settlements, and have seen him coming
out of the darkness of those early ages into Mesopotamia,
the Land Between the Rivers, where our first written history
seems to begin.</p>

<p>Here, with great cities, temples, and a high degree of
civilization and culture, we have found priests studying the
stars and making sun-dials and clepsydr&aelig; in order to tell
the time by shadows, sunbeams, or the dropping of water.
We have taken a glimpse at the wonderful people of
Greece and Rome, and have seen how, as they became
more cultured, they found it necessary to have more accurate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>means of telling time. We have considered the advantages
and disadvantages of the sand-glass, have found
clumsy pieces of clock-work in church towers, getting their
running power from weights, in order to strike the bells,
and have stood with young Galileo in the Cathedral at
Pisa, when a swinging lamp gave him the idea of the
pendulum.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have seen the making of smaller clocks—that
were made smaller and smaller until they could be carried
as watches, in which springs were used instead of weights.
Following this, it has been merely a question of improvement,
as one inventor after another has hit upon some idea
that would do away with this or that difficulty.</p>

<p>Thus we have come, in the time of Shakespeare, to a
clever little contrivance that ticked beautifully but registered
time rather badly; that took a long while to manufacture
by hand, and cost so much that only the rich could
afford to buy it, and that, in consequence, people were
proud to own, but did not take seriously as a timepiece.</p>

<p>In all this journey, covering thousands of years, one
thing has made itself clear to us—the story of timepieces
is not a mere mechanical story; it is a human story. Men
did not put together certain pieces of wood or metal in
order merely to make mechanism, but to meet a vital need.
One might almost say that the story of the watch is in the
watch itself. The works run and the hands move because of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>the mainspring, which by pressing steadily forces them
into motion. In very much the same way, the busy brains
of the inventors and the busy hands of the workmen have
been kept active because advancing civilization has been
like a great mainspring, always pressing upon larger affairs
and greater numbers of people, always needing to fit
its engagements more and more closely together, and always
calling for better and better means for telling time.
Thus, if the watch in the days of Shakespeare and Queen
Elizabeth was still an inaccurate timepiece, its improvement
was a foregone conclusion. Brains and hands were
still active; civilization was still pressing.</p>

<p>It is said that a hog helped in the next development; he
helped quite unconsciously by furnishing a bristle. In
order to understand this, we must remember Galileo's
swinging lamp and the pendulum that the Englishman,
Hooke, and the Hollander, Huyghens, applied in the making
of clocks. It will be recalled that a pendulum swings in
arcs of different lengths in exactly the same time and that
this property is called <em>isochronism</em>. Both Hooke and
Huyghens could see that the application of isochronism
would be quite as valuable in a watch as in a clock, but
they realized that this could not be accomplished by means
of the pendulum. Therefore, each began to experiment,
and each seems to have hit upon the same idea as a substitute
for the pendulum in about the year 1665.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>This is where the hog's bristle came into use. One end
was made fast while the other was bent back and forth by
the balance, as it swung to and fro. Being short and stiff,
it acted as a spring; in fact, its motion was something like
the swing of a small pendulum, and some people incorrectly
claim that the name of <em>hair-spring</em> first came from
this use of a hair. Of course, a very fine steel was soon substituted
for the bristle. Next, it was realized that there
would be an advantage if a much longer spring were used,
and obviously the only way in which this could be done
was by making it in the form of a coil, and so we have the
delicate, coiled hair-spring, as it is found in our own
watches to-day.</p>

<p>The principle of the hair-spring is not unlike that of the
pendulum: the farther the pendulum is swung out from
the lowest point of its arc, the greater is the force that
gets it back; and the farther a spring is bent from its position
of rest, the greater is the force exerted to get it back.
With both of these devices it is possible to obtain regular
beats and steady motion.</p>

<p>It is hard to realize that nearly a hundred years must
have passed by before the hair-spring came into common
use. To-day any new device is described in catalogs, written
up in the papers, manufactured in quantities and is
quickly carried by travelers into every country, but in
those days everything was still made by hand, piece by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>piece, and there was comparatively little travel that would
admit of its distribution. Ideas made their way very
slowly. In fact, Julien Le Roy rediscovered the principle of
isochronism and announced it with a good deal of pride,
quite ignorant of the fact that Hooke and Huyghens explained
it nearly a century before. And so the hair-spring
was slowly adopted by English watchmakers with a number
of minor improvements.</p>

<p>Other inventors, of whom presently we shall hear more,
worked out better methods of escapement, and the watch
movement developed slowly toward its present form. It
became possible to tell time more accurately and to make
arrangements and plans more closely as the watch became
a better time-keeper. The pace of life was speeding up, and
people were realizing the value of minutes—even of seconds.
Therefore the minute- and second-hands were added
to the hour-hand that so long had moved alone around the
watch-dial. And in 1704, Nicholas Facio, a Swiss doing
business in London, introduced jeweled bearings into the
mechanism.</p>

<p>The importance of jewels is often misunderstood even at
the present day. Many people do not know why jewels are
used in a watch, assuming that they are intended for
ornament or in some way to increase the value. But most
of the jewels in a watch-movement are placed out of sight;
and, although they often consist of real rubies or sapphires,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>they are so tiny and their intrinsic value so small
that no watch requires more than one dollar's worth of
jewels. They are strictly utilitarian in their purpose. A
pivot or bearing, running in a hole drilled in a jewel, creates
almost no friction and requires so little oil that a single
drop as big as a pinhead is enough for an entire watch. Because
jewels are so hard and smooth, a watch with jeweled
bearings runs better and wears less and requires less power
to drive it, than one in which they are lacking.</p>

<p>During all the time recounted, the great mainspring of
civilization had been pressing, ever pressing. Nothing
could be considered "good enough" if a way could be found
to improve it.</p>

<p>At last an improvement came out of the sea. Travel had
been reaching out in every direction; ships were fitted out
by scores to take goods from England or the continent of
Europe to lands across the seas and to bring back the products
of these countries.</p>

<p>The time had been, but a few generations earlier, when
people had stood on the shores of the ocean and had wondered
what might lie beyond their sight. That water
stretched out to the "edge of the world" they felt sure, but
what there happened to it they could not tell. Surely, however,
it must be peopled with monsters and demons. It was
foolhardy to venture too far from land. We can hardly
realize what a piece of insane rashness it must have seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>to most people when Columbus sailed out boldly into this
vast mystery, nor how the world was thrilled when he
brought back word of strange lands and strange peoples
he had found beyond the horizon.</p>

<p>But by the time now reached in our story the oceans had
become highways of trade, and men were beginning to
draw those strange, crude maps of the continents, which
make us smile until we stop to think how maps might have
looked had they been left for us to make. At all events, the
problems involved in navigation were being much discussed
in every land.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of these problems was to discover the
whereabouts of the ship at any given time. When one is out
of sight of land the sense of location necessarily becomes
inoperative; one wave looks like another, and there are
winds and currents which might carry a ship hundreds of
miles out of its course unless there were some way of
knowing its true position. At first, the stars, and later the
compass gave help in giving <em>direction</em> but not in showing
<em>position</em>. How might this be done? There was no possible
way in which the element of telling time did not enter.</p>

<p>That sounds a bit strange until one stops to think of the
rotation of the earth once in twenty-four hours. If one
could travel around the earth, from east to west, at a uniform
rate in exactly twenty-four hours, he would find
clocks and watches indicating the exact minute he started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>at every step of his journey; and the sun would remain
steadily at the same height above the horizon, if he always
kept to one parallel of latitude. His rate of speed would
have to be about eighteen miles a minute, if he chose to
travel along the equator, or to state this same thing in
another way, when it is noon in New York, it is 11 A. M.
in Chicago, 10 A. M. in Denver and 9 A. M. in San Francisco;
it is also 1 P. M. several hundred miles out into the
Atlantic; 2 P. M. still farther out; 5 P. M. in London;
and so on. In other words, it is some one of all the moments
of the twenty-four-hour day at the <em>same time</em>, but <em>the time
that indicates each of these moments is different at different
points</em>. Therefore, if you could find out the time at any
point, and could compare it with the time at the place you
had left, you would know just how far east or west you had
come, but not how far north or south.</p>

<p>Ascertaining the time was not difficult; at noon it would
be shown by the sun. Nor was it difficult to compare the
time provided one had an <em>accurate</em> timepiece, but a watch
that ran either fast or slow might mislead one by hundreds
of miles. You can see how important it was that navigators
have some means of <em>exactly</em> measuring time. This was
one of the points at which the great mainspring of civilization
pressed hardest upon the brains of inventors and the
hands of workmen.</p>

<p>So, from the sixteenth century onward, the leading governments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>of Europe offered large rewards for a chronometer
sufficiently accurate to determine longitude at sea. In
England, Parliament offered twenty thousand pounds, or
one hundred thousand dollars, for a time-keeper which,
throughout a voyage to the West Indies, would give the
longitude within thirty miles. This meant that it must keep
time within a minute a month, or two seconds a day. Both
Huyghens and Hooke somewhat naively attempted to
make a pendulum clock keep time at sea; but imagine the
action of a pendulum while a ship was rolling and tossing!</p>

<p>The problem was really one for the watchmaker, since a
clock is made for keeping time while standing in one position
and a watch for keeping time while being moved
about. John Harrison, the inventor of the famous <em>gridiron</em>
pendulum, finally won the munificent prize. In 1762,
after several trials and failures, he succeeded in producing
a timepiece which varied, under test, only a minute and
four seconds during a voyage of some five months. This
was excellent timekeeping—far within half a second a day;
it made it possible for a captain at sea to determine his
position within eighteen miles. Harrison's mechanism was
too complicated for description in these pages. Indeed, it
was so difficult of comprehension that, before paying him
his reward, the English government asked Harrison to
write a book of explanation in order that his inventions
might be copied by other makers. He did so and finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>received the money. Harrison's ideas have now been
greatly simplified, but, in general, his plan is used in the
making of marine chronometers to this day; thus, in a
sense, it is due to Harrison's brain that our great ships are
able to cross the ocean on almost schedule time.</p>

<p>Both the first success of the chronometer and the later
efforts toward improving it had a great influence upon the
next few generations of watchmakers; the final improvements
were made in the days of the American Revolution.
It was at this latter period that a man named Thomas
Mudge worked out the kind of escapement that is still
used in our watches. A little later, the Swiss-Parisian,
Abraham Louis Bregu&eacute;t, improved the hair-spring by
bending its outer coil across the others to their center and
fastening it at that point in order that the spiral of the
spring should expand equally in all directions from the
center.</p>

<p>The last development of importance consisted in doing
away with the fusee. The faults of this device had been the
need of a thick watch to give it room, and the danger that
a broken mainspring might destroy other parts of the
movement in its recoil. French and Swiss watchmakers
reduced the friction until it needed very little power to run
the mechanism, and then were able to employ a mainspring
which was not stiff enough to require a fusee. American
makers adopted this idea, but the British clung to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>fusee and the stiff spring; it has cost them much of their
prestige as watchmakers and much of their trade.</p>

<p>Thus, the mechanism of both clocks and watches was
practically in its present state by the year 1800. The
"grandfather's clock" of that date may look old-fashioned,
but it tells time a modern way, and the mechanical ideas in
George Washington's watch were not so very different
from those which we find in our own. There have been
many small improvements since, but the great inventions
had all been made.</p>

<p>It is interesting to remember that most of these inventions
are due to the English artisans of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, although in delicate workmanship
and beautiful decoration, they were equaled and perhaps
excelled by the Swiss and by the French. The work of producing
a satisfactory timekeeping machine, begun by
priests and by astronomers, and carried forward by the
demands of the navigator and the patient labor of the
craftsman, had ended after thousands of years, in triumph.
The ticking contrivance of wheels, levers, and springs was
no longer a mechanical toy; it was a marvelous instrument
which was made by man with his head and hands and yet
was almost as accurate in its action as the sun and stars
themselves.</p>

<p>Here ends the first great division of our story. The scientific
problem had been solved; what remained was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>democratize the keeping of time; to place mechanism equal
to the best of those days within the reach and within the
means of every man. In this later development the work
was to pass out of the hands of artists and inventors into
those of manufacturers. Its history from this point on is no
longer a record of science but a romance of industry.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>CHAPTER TEN<br />

<small><i>The "Worshipful Company" and
English Watchmaking</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> the beginning, there are two sides to the
history of timekeeping. The first is the story of
discovery and invention—how men labored for
thousands of years to produce a contrivance that would
really tell the time. But if only a few such machines
existed in the world, it would be of very little use to
humanity in general, however perfect each might be.
Accordingly history must now recount how clocks and
watches came to be made in sufficiently large numbers
and at sufficiently low cost to be within the reach of all
who needed them.</p>

<p>The turning-point from the inventive to the industrial
side of the development was reached about the year 1800.
Timekeeping has always been a part of history, and history
a part of timekeeping, and this opening of the nineteenth
century was a period when history itself was changing, for
the progress of civilization is like a journey over a mountain
road; one must needs turn occasionally or one can rise
no higher. The American Revolution had ended but a few
years before, and the thinly settled states were trying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>strange experiment of having the people govern themselves
without a king. In the old world, the people of France had
suddenly risen up and seized the power from <em>their</em> king, and
a bloody struggle had ensued in which many of the old
nobility had been beheaded. In England, the power of the
throne was growing less and the power of the people
greater. In fact, the whole world was becoming more and
more filled with democratic ideas and ideals than ever
before.</p>

<p>Now, this same democratic idea that set up republics
was getting ready to put a watch into every man's pocket.
At first, everyone had told the time for himself, and had
told it badly. Now, after thousands of years, it had come
about that a few had the means of telling time accurately.
The great inventors mentioned in the last few chapters had
contributed one idea after another, until, among them all
they had worked out clocks and watches that would keep
correct time. But these timepieces were not yet convenient
in form, and they certainly were not yet convenient in
price for the average man. They still were made by hand in
small quantities, and such a condition would have to be
changed before it would be possible for <em>everyone</em> to tell the
time and to <em>tell it well</em>.</p>

<p>Naturally, the industrial and business development of
watchmaking began long before 1800, long before, indeed,
the time at which the inventions were all complete. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>centuries the two sides of the story, the inventive and the
industrial, had progressed side by side, but for the sake of
clearness, we have described the inventions first. Now we
must glance back again to the time of Shakespeare, when
the period of modern inventions was just beginning, in
order to see how the <em>business</em> side of watchmaking started
upon its growth.</p>

<p>Four nations have been concerned in this development—England,
France, Switzerland, and the United States.
The English worked in one way; the French worked in
another; the Swiss, in still another; while the Americans
took up the final organization of the work in a manner that
was thoroughly typical of their peculiar genius.</p>

<p>The mechanical improvements and inventions were
mostly made, as we know, by the English. But for the beginnings
of the watch industry in England one must go
back to a time before the days of Hooke and Huyghens, to
the year 1627, the year of incorporation of the <i>Worshipful
Clock-makers, Company</i>. Imagine such a name being
chosen to-day! The Worshipful Clock-makers' Company
was the original trade-organization of the business in England.
It was not at all like our modern companies but was
one of those great trade "guilds" which played such an
important part in the development of European industry.</p>

<p>People sometimes think of the medieval trade-guild as
something like the modern trade-union, but this is a mistake;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>it was in many ways quite different. Perhaps one
might call it a sort of a cross between a labor-union and a
manufacturing trust. Within a certain district, all who
were occupied in a particular business were required to
belong to the guild; otherwise they were not allowed to do
business, and the "district" might include the whole country.
In order to gain an idea of a guild, imagine in this
country a single association of jewelers to which everyone
connected with the jewelry business was forced to belong,
whether he were manufacturer or retailer, employer, or
employee, the head of his firm or the last new clerk behind
the counter. Or, to look at it in another way, imagine a
trust controlling the whole industry and a union including
all the workmen under a closed-shop system, and then suppose
that the trust and the union were one and the same.
That would be like one of the great medieval guilds. It was
easy for such an organization to create a monopoly of the
entire national product.</p>

<p>Sometimes the guild would forbid the importation of
foreign goods and would not permit workmen to come from
other countries. It usually regulated, to some extent, the
conditions of wages and labor. It fixed its own standards of
quality of the product; if goods did not come up to this
standard, they might not be sold, and the rules of the guild
had practically the force of law. But it did not attempt to
control prices, nor to limit the quantity of production, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>to interfere, except very indirectly, with free competition
among its own members.</p>

<p>Thus, it was not, in our modern sense of the conception,
a company at all, but an association of independent manufacturers
or tradesmen, each in business for himself, each
in competition with his fellow craftsmen, and all kept upon
a tolerably even footing by limiting the amount of labor
that each one might employ. Its members were the master
craftsmen, each the head of his own house; through them
were associated the journeymen, or skilled workmen in
their employ, and the apprentices. These latter might rise
to be masters, in business for themselves. But no one without
such a connection could engage in the business at all,
in any capacity whatever.</p>

<p>The Worshipful Clock-makers' Company, under its
charter granted by Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>, had the power to make rules
for the government of all persons following the trade within
ten miles of London, and for regulating the trade
throughout the kingdom. Its first master, or president, was
David Ramsay, who was mentioned as having been "constructor
of horologes to His Most Sacred Majesty, James
<abbr title="the first">I</abbr>," and is one of the characters in Scott's novel "<cite>The
Fortunes of Nigel</cite>." Its wardens or executives were Henry
Archer, John Willowe, and Sampson Shelton; and there
was, besides, a fellowship, or board of directors. The company
proceeded at once to forbid all persons "making,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>buying, selling, transporting, and importing any bad,
deceitful clocks, watches, larums, sun-dials or cases for the
said trade," and full power to search for, confiscate and
destroy all such inferior goods, "or cause them to be
amended."</p>

<p>This company limited the volume of business by forbidding
any one master to employ more than two apprentices
at one time without express permission; and, since all
journeymen must first pass through the stage of apprenticeship,
this tended to keep up wages by limiting the labor
supply and to keep competition on a fair basis. The coat of
arms of the company represented a clock surmounted by
a crown, the feet resting upon the backs of four lions, all of
gold, upon a black ground; on either side were the figures
of Father Time and of a king in royal robes; and the motto
beneath read: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tempus Imperator Rerum</i>, or "Time, the
Emperor of Things." These matters sound rather quaint to
us, but perhaps the quaintest of them all is the idea of a
monopoly concerning itself so jealously with the quality of
the product, and letting prices and competition practically
alone.</p>

<p>It was under such conditions that the English work was
done and the inventions made. Huyghens was, of course,
not an Englishman; and Hooke was rather an inventor
and a scientist than a manufacturer. Both these men themselves
made clocks and watches, but they made them only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>as instruments to assist them in their researches, or as
working-models of their design. It was often said of Hooke
that he never cared to develop an invention after he had
proved that it would work. But once these first inventions
had been adopted, the real production of timepieces was in
the hands of the Clock-makers' Company, and the great
names were those of clock-makers.</p>

<p>These were the days when the leaders of the industry
worked with their own hands as well as with their heads.
We may imagine the master seated in the front room of his
shop studying over a new model, or putting together and
decorating one already made; or, perhaps, making with his
own hands some of the most delicate parts. From the back
rooms would come the sound of tapping or filing as the
journeymen and apprentices were hard at work upon their
various tasks. Meanwhile, perhaps some apprentice, standing
outside the door, would call out to passers-by and urge
them to step in and buy. This was a favorite form of advertising
in that time. For that matter, we still have our
"barkers" and "pullers-in" at Coney Island and elsewhere.
Everything about the small business was carried out under
the personal direction of the master and, where necessary,
by his own hand. The phrase "clockmaker to the King"
meant something more when applied to such a man than
merely that royalty had purchased some product of his
craft.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>Such a one was Thomas Tompion, often called "the
father of English watchmaking." He was the leader of his
craft in the time of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> and he, more than anyone
else, worked out the inventions of Hooke for actual manufacture.
He left his father's blacksmith shop to become a
clock-maker, from this he went on to the more delicate
work of making watches, and at last became a famous master
of his guild. It may fairly be said of him that he set the
time for history in his day, for most of the royalty and
great men of Europe timed all their doings from banquets
to battles by Tompion watches.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he, too, was making watchmaking history
by his improvements. Tompion made watches with hair-springs,
balance-wheels and escapements with various improvements.
His design of the regulator is nearly that in
modern use. His cases, too, were as famous as the movements
that he made. The so-called "pendulum watches"
were then much in fashion, and Tompion met the demand
by making a number of them. They did not, of course, work
with a pendulum; but one arm of the old foliot balance
could be seen through an opening in the case or dial, and
looked like a pendulum swinging to and fro. To read the
advertisements of that day one would think that all lost or
stolen watches were of Tompion's making, so often does his
name appear in them.</p>

<p>Many legendary stories are told about Tompion's work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>It has been set down in cold print that Queen Mary gave
one of his watches to Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> of Spain, and that he made
watches for Queen Elizabeth. Unfortunately for such
stories, Tompion was not born until 1638, by which time
both Mary and Elizabeth had been dead for some years.
But though the legends themselves are untrue, yet they do
shed some light upon their subject, for such stories, true or
false, are not told about unimportant men. And it is true
that Tompion grew so celebrated that at his death, in 1713,
he was buried in Westminster Abbey, where only the great
may have resting-places.</p>

<p>Another famous watchmaker was George Graham, the
inventor of the mercury pendulum. He first was Tompion's
journeyman, then his partner, and at last became a well-known
astronomer, having become interested in astronomy
through making astronomical clocks. But his great contribution
was the invention of the <em>dead-beat escapement</em>,
which, in one form or another, is in use in all the best
clocks and watches of the present time, and which has had
more to do with making their accuracy possible than has
any other improvement since the discovery of the isochronism
of the pendulum and hair-springs. Graham, also,
is buried in Westminster Abbey; his body lies beside that
of Tompion, his teacher and friend.</p>

<p>Another famous figure was Daniel Quare, the first to
devise the mechanism for driving the two hands as we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>it to-day. Quare was a Quaker, and was no less prominent
in the Society of Friends than in his business. As a Quaker,
he was opposed to taking an oath of any kind, and was
what we now call a "conscientious objector" to warfare.
Therefore, at the same time that he was being honored by
royalty for his work, he was being prosecuted and fined for
his refusal to pay taxes for the support of the army and of
the Established Church. When he was made clock-maker
to King George <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>, means had to be devised for excusing
him from taking the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>It was Quare who originated the practise of giving to
each watch a serial number, so that it could always be
identified. This is, of course, a common custom with us; we
also number automobiles, and many other manufactured
articles of value, and Quare's device of numbering watch-movements
may very well have given the start to all this.</p>

<p>Still other famous watchmakers were Harrison and
Arnold and Earnshaw, who between them developed and
perfected the marine chronometer that we discussed in the
last chapter; and Mudge, in whose hands watch-movements
really became modern in type. Men of this kind thought
first of producing reliable work which would give service;
ornaments, curiosities of workmanship, and even convenience,
were secondary. Some of these men were extremely
independent; for example, Arnold, in his early
days and by way of establishing a reputation, made a repeating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>watch less than a half-inch in diameter—so small
that it was worn set in a ring; but when King George <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>
had bought the masterpiece, and the Empress of Russia
offered one thousand guineas (more than five thousand
dollars) for a duplicate, Arnold coolly excused himself on
the plea that he desired the specimen to remain unique.</p>

<p>Time passed; machinery began to be employed in manufacturing
and hand-work declined. The guild system in
every line slowly changed into our modern organized industry.
This was only natural, for factories were becoming
larger, their output was increasing and the head of the
business was no longer likely to be himself a master workman.
The greater part of this change, of course, took
place in the nineteenth century, and was primarily owing
to the increased use of machine-power and improvement
in transportation. But as regards watchmaking in England,
the substitution never became complete, for the bulldog
quality in the Englishman has always made him hold
fast to his ideas. Habits died hard, and the old methods
were changed slowly and under protest, even when these
changes spelled progress.</p>

<p>At first, as we have seen, the watch was the work of one
man and of his assistants, and was almost entirely handmade.
In those days, the trade was supplied by a multitude
of small independent manufacturers. To make a
single watch might take weeks or months; and every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>must be made separately and patiently, regardless of
labor or expense. So long as this method could hold its
own, the English watchmakers led the world; their
watches were good, but they certainly were not cheap.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The gallant of Colonial times often carried two watches, as was
the fashion, but often they were both unreliable.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>After a time, other countries began to use more modern
methods, and English watches could no longer stand competition
in the world's markets. However, the bulldog
quality still held; English manufacturers preferred to lose
ground rather than change their methods. The introduction
of machinery and the employment of women operatives
were each bitterly opposed. Factory production was
never adopted on a large scale, nor was there much combination
of small independent manufacturers. Necessarily,
these things did, at last, come to be done; but half-heartedly,
and without much success. At one time, for example,
there were some forty small factories making various parts
which each watch manufacturer assembled and adjusted
for himself.</p>

<p>The Clock-makers' Company is still in existence; although
now, of course, it has developed into a society like
the ordinary modern association of manufacturers. Under
pressure of change and competition, English manufacturers
were compelled unwillingly to change their system
of production, but the character of the watches they would
not change. The same country which had made so many
of the mechanical inventions finally settled down into satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>with its models at a time when other nations were
continuing to make improvements, as, for example, when
they clung to the fusee after watchmakers abroad had
found a better substitute.</p>

<p>The English watch has remained heavy, substantial, and
reliable; it is an excellent mechanism produced regardless
of expense. Such a watch cannot be made cheaply, least of
all by British methods. There has been something obstinate
in the maker's attitude; if the law of supply and demand
called for something different, so much the worse for
the law. The English have been slow to see the possibilities
in the cheap watch. They have not realized that a watch
need not be expensive in order to keep good time. They
<em>started</em> to put the watch into universal use, but left to
other nations the completion of the process.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN<br />

<small><i>What Happened in France and
Switzerland</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Across</span> the English Channel lives a race of a very
different character. The French are people of
highly adaptable minds; often they see possibilities
in the inventions of other nations which those other
nations have failed themselves to see. The automobile was
first made in the United States, but the French soon developed
it into something that was better than our early
clumsy cars, and we were years in overtaking them. The
Wright Brothers first learned the secret of aerial flight, and
then Wilbur Wright sailed for France, where the people
went wild with enthusiasm over the idea of flying; it was in
France that aviation really became what it is to-day.</p>

<p>The French have always been fine mechanics and finished
workmen. It was to be expected that they would do
something artistic and interesting with the manufacture of
timepieces. They could not make a better watch than the
British were turning out toward the end of the eighteenth
century. Nobody could—but they could make it more
beautiful. In Shakespeare's time and afterward, while
watches were still more valuable as works of art than they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>could be as timepieces, the richest work of this nature was
done in France. There watches were made in the form of
mandolins and other musical instruments, in the form of
flowers, in the form of jeweled butterflies, and in wonderful
cases, painted and enameled and engraved. In the J.
Pierpont Morgan collection in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, New York, there is a watch which, in 1800, on the
fete-day after the battle of Marengo, Napoleon Bonaparte
gave to Murat, who was his brother-in-law and one
of his generals. On the back cover of this watch appears a
miniature portrait of Napoleon himself. And since he himself
was the author of the gift, one may assume that it
represented the Great Emperor's own conception of himself.</p>

<p>The wrist-watch, to-day a military necessity, was at
first a French idea. It is interesting to learn that the
merchants and makers of this kind of work were in their
own time called neither watchmakers nor horologists, but
toymen. There again is shown the old idea about watches;
they were not timepieces but toys.</p>

<p>Later on, toward the end of the period of invention,
when first, the clock, and soon afterward, the watch, had
become fairly accurate timekeepers, the French makers
again took the lead in the same way; once more they beautified
what they could not practically improve. The French
clocks of the period of Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr> and his successors are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>celebrated for their design. One might easily suppose, from
an examination of the great modern collections of rare and
precious watches in our museums that the French had been
the leading watchmakers of the world, for the specimens
there found being selected chiefly for beauty or value from
the collector's point of view, are oftener of French than of
any other make. Yet it must not be supposed that the
French made no inventions. The credit for some of the important
improvements is disputed between the English,
French and Swiss, and it is not always easy to decide
which nation has the better claim. Furthermore, certain of
the French watchmakers came from Switzerland while at
various times, some of those in France moved to England,
especially during the reign of Terror. The distinctions are
somewhat confused and we can only speak in a general
way.</p>

<p>However, while the watchmaking industry was developing
in France, it gave forth a seed which took root in new
soil. In the hill country of eastern France, in the town of
Autun, there lived a watchmaker named Charles Cusin.
One day, in 1574, for reasons that we do not know, he
moved a few miles eastward across the border into Switzerland
and there settled in the beautiful lake city of Geneva.
He probably had no thought that this personal act of a
private citizen would have an effect upon history, but an
industry employing thousands of people and making millions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>of dollars worth of goods can be traced back to the
time when he crossed the border.</p>

<p>Remember that this was back in the days of Shakespeare
and Queen Elizabeth, while watches were still
esteemed jewels and ornaments for the wealthy, and when
the improvements which later made them practically useful
had not yet been invented. The business side of watchmaking
was thus growing up at the same time with the
inventive and scientific; it was preparing itself for the day
when the mechanism should be perfected, and the only
remaining task would be to popularize its perfection.</p>

<p>Charles Cusin liked Switzerland and thirteen years later
he became a citizen. In the course of time, he was active in
founding a watchmaker's guild in Geneva and from that
period Geneva watches have been famous. This does not
mean that Switzerland had contained no watchmakers
before Cusin's appearance, but we are considering the
beginnings of a great industry and not mere instances of
isolated workmen. The man from Autun seems to have
been one of those energetic leaders who see possibilities and
know how to organize. It is largely through such men that
the world progresses.</p>

<p>You will remember that in an early chapter we touched
upon the way in which men first began to exchange the
results of their work in order that each man might devote
most of his time to the special task for which he was best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>fitted, such as hunting, or the making of weapons. Through
this exchange, <em>everyone</em> was enabled to live better than
<em>anyone</em> could have lived by himself. But if it were true
that people doing <em>different</em> things could help each other, it
also became true, after a while, that people doing the <em>same</em>
thing could help each other and could help the general public,
by learning to co-operate. They could exchange ideas,
improve their work, and bring about better conditions.
This was one of the effects of the guilds—they changed
crafts into industries.</p>

<p>The guild with which Charles Cusin now had to do—some
say he was its sole founder—was a very dignified and
important board of master-workmen. It was founded
about fifty years earlier than was the Worshipful Clock-makers'
Company in England, and its members were no
ordinary workmen. Switzerland was, and still is, a thoroughly
independent little country and a man skilful
enough to make a whole watch with his own hands was apt
to be a man who realized his own worth.</p>

<p>The members of this guild were decidedly particular
about their dignity and their meetings were serious occasions,
as may be seen from Article <abbr title="1">I</abbr> of their regulations
which read: "Whenever the master workmen shall meet in
a body to discuss subjects pertaining to their guild, they
shall, before proceeding to such discussion, offer prayer to
God beseeching Him that all that they say and do may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>rebound to His glory and may further the interests of
these people."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact this dignity was based upon a correct
conception that has been somewhat overlooked in the
present busy age. The man who has to do either with the
manufacture or sale of timepieces does well to take his position
seriously since he is a most important link in our
entire civilization. Such a man may well reflect upon the
fact that without the timepieces which he produces or sells,
the world would drop into hopeless confusion, for human
society is able to run smoothly and efficiently only when it
is correctly timed. Workmen and dealers engaged in such
a vital industry have a great responsibility to their fellow-men.</p>

<p>It is probable that members of this guild who met from
time to time in the Swiss city by the lake shores, under the
shadows of the snow-topped Alps, realized something of
this responsibility. Their timepieces were not yet as accurate
as are ours of to-day, and the world was not yet so busy
that its affairs required the closest adjustment, but they at
least were trying earnestly to keep the human cogs running
smoothly by turning out watches as nearly perfect as
their skill and knowledge would permit.</p>

<p>This may be seen again in Article <abbr title="5">V</abbr> of their regulations;
"The functions of the jurors are to enforce the laws of the
guild and to provide that there be no infringement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>same. To this end, they shall be required to visit each
journeyman at least four times during the year, having
power to seize all articles which do not conform to the
specifications now in force, to report all delinquents to the
worthy governing board, and to punish the offenders in
accordance with the gravity of their fault."</p>

<p>It is quite clear that Geneva was out for quality in
watches, and, indeed the name of the Swiss city has always
been associated with quality. Nevertheless, they were no
angels—those old Swiss craftsmen; they were in fact quite
preponderatingly human. Thus it was not long before they
began to make a tight little monopoly of their business.
They restricted the number of workmen who might be admitted
to the guild, and they secured special ordinances by
means of which all other watchmakers were forbidden to
establish themselves within a certain distance of the city.
In other words, they did not purpose allowing the new
and promising industry to grow beyond their control.</p>

<p>There were, however, other independent people in those
days who hadn't the slightest intention of being bound by
such restrictions. Here and there, a watchmaker left
Geneva to carry on his work in some foreign city, as, for
example, in Besancon, France. Thus began a competition
which grew and spread as time went on.</p>

<p>This competition developed some interesting features.
For example, the guild in Geneva obtained the passage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>laws forbidding anyone from bringing into the city, in a
finished state, a watch constructed within a certain distance.
"Schemes" for watches and certain parts might be
made at will, but only members of the citizen guild were
permitted to complete these schemes.</p>

<p>Such restrictions naturally did not tend toward low-priced
watches; but all watches in those days were necessarily
high-priced, and a man wealthy enough to afford one
was apt to seek the best that could be bought. Geneva's
strictness gave it so great a reputation that during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries foreign watchmakers
flocked to the Swiss city very much as art students later
journeyed to Paris, and it became the acknowledged center
of the European industry. As time went on the demand for
time-pieces became more widespread and many Genevans
moved to other cities where they became dealers in Geneva
watches. It is said that, in 1725, the city of Constantinople
contained as many as eighty-eight mercantile agents who
had become established in this way.</p>

<p>One hundred years after the founding of the guild,
Geneva was producing five thousand watches a year, having
one hundred masters of the guild and three hundred
journeymen. Now five thousand watches is no small output
when it is considered that each one must be constructed
entirely by hand and occupied a matter of weeks in the
making; yet, by 1799, the city contained nearly six thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>watchmakers and jewelers and was producing fifty
thousand timepieces a year.</p>

<p>Not many miles to the northward from Geneva is another
mountain city—that of Neuchatel. Neuchatel also
contained an enterprising and skilful population, for the
Swiss people seem to have been naturally ingenious and
skilful in the use of tools. Doubtless the mountainous
character of the country has had something to do with this
fact; farming and fruit-raising are slow, hard work in their
rocky soil and severe climate and the making of bulky articles
is not desirable where transportation must be had
over mountain trails.</p>

<p>The Swiss with their clever fingers had long been famous
for their wood-carving; now, when they had a chance at an
industry which called for delicate and skilful hand-work
and which produced goods of small size and high value, it
exactly suited them.</p>

<p>Geneva "saw it first," but kept it so closely to herself
that it was several generations later before watches were
known in the Neuchatel district not far away, yet, this
district is another great center of the industry.</p>

<p>It is said that in 1680, more than one hundred years after
Charles Cusin moved to Geneva, a horse-dealer from the
little town of La Sagne, came home from his travels and
brought with him an English watch. Great was the wonder
that it excited among the simple people of his native place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>They passed from hand to hand the little ticking mechanism
which had the strange power to tell time, and then one
day the ticking ceased, which perhaps is not surprising, in
view of the freedom with which the watch had been handled.</p>

<p>The horse-dealer knew nothing of the mechanism but
was very anxious to have the works set right. It chanced
that there was a young locksmith in La Sagne, a lad of only
fifteen, named Daniel Jean Richard, who was so skilful and
ingenious that he had already made repairs in the tower
clock of the village. "Show the watch to Daniel Jean
Richard" said everybody.</p>

<p>The delighted lad began to take the delicate mechanism
apart, studying carefully each wheel and spring and lever
until he felt that he understood exactly how it should
work. Then, when he had succeeded in reassembling the
parts and in making the watch tick bravely once more, he
was seized with a great ambition to build another one all
by himself.</p>

<p>After many experiments with his crude locksmith tools,
he did produce a watch which would run and which would
tell time after a fashion—the first watch ever made in the
Neuchatel district—but it did not satisfy his artist's soul
and he realized that he must have better tools.</p>

<p>Somebody told him that there was in Geneva a machine
for cutting wheels, and he set out to see it for himself, only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>to come back sadly disappointed. Wherever he asked to see
the machine, the canny Geneva craftsmen shook their
heads. This eager lad from another town had far too intelligent
a face to be allowed to learn the precious secrets.
The most that they would do was to let him have a few of
the wheels made by the machine.</p>

<p>Then he began to work out for himself a machine to cut
the wheels, and at last succeeded in the task, so that before
long he was well on the way to becoming a watch manufacturer.
Richard, however, was generous with his ideas; he
instructed a number of the young men of his district, so
that watchmaking soon began to flourish in his town and in
those about it.</p>

<p>We have now seen how the watchmaking industry became
established in two great centers—in Geneva, where the
highest quality was maintained, but under the rule of the
guild, which did not encourage quantity of output, and in
the Neuchatel region where no guild system existed. In the
course of time this latter region overtook and passed in
quantity of output that of Geneva. By 1818, the Neuchatel
district of the Jura was turning out watches at the rate
of 130,000 a year.</p>

<p>The solid old Geneva watchmakers criticized their rivals
as being less exacting in quality and less careful as to the
standard of gold used in their cases, but the Neuchatel
people had no difficulty in finding customers; we read that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>one hundred and forty of their merchants went twice a
year to the Leipsig fair, where they sometimes sold watches
to the value of four million francs ($800,000) in a year.</p>

<p>The two principal centers of Swiss watchmaking have
been mentioned although, of course, watches were made in
other districts as well. It is easy to see that many generations
ago it had already become a very large industry, and
so we need not be surprised to learn that even to-day the
tiny inland country produces a larger annual export value
of watches than even our vast United States. Watchmaking
has been so large a source of wealth that the Swiss government
has aided it in every way, including the establishment
of schools and courses for training skilled workmen.
More than sixty thousand Swiss people are directly employed
in the Swiss watch industry and over three hundred
thousand, or one-twelfth of the entire population, are indirectly
connected with it. The Swiss have also made many
inventions and improvements so that they have had much
to do with the development of the watch itself as well as
with the industry.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, it was a Swiss who invented the
fusee, another who introduced the use of jewels for reducing
friction and the stemwind is also of Swiss origin. It was
the Swiss, too, who, early in the nineteenth century, did
away with the solid upper plate which covered the works
and used, instead, a system of bridges. The bridge form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>movement allows each part to be repaired or adjusted separately
and to-day it is to be found in all watches of the
higher grades.</p>

<p>The Swiss invention of the fusee, described in Chapter
<abbr title="8">VIII</abbr>, played an important part for several hundred years,
but at last it was replaced by something simpler and still
more effective. Made to equalize the difference in the pressure
exerted by a stiff mainspring when first wound up and
when partly run down, it worked beautifully but was
rather clumsy; and it required comparatively heavier parts
which naturally necessitated the use of greater power.
Thus friction and, consequently, wear were increased. But
the Swiss by making watch-parts that were very light but
yet strong, and by reducing friction principally through
the introduction of jewels into the mechanism, succeeded
at last in getting a movement that could be run with very
little power. So they now could use a weak and slender
mainspring, made so long that only its middle part ever
was wound and unwound, and thus the pressure remained
equal, and the use of the fusee was no longer necessary.
This principle, called the "going barrel" construction, reduced
friction, and made the thin modern watch a possibility.
The American makers, as we shall presently see,
adopted the "going barrel" construction practically from
the first. They had no traditional prejudices, and they
knew a good mechanical idea when they saw it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>But the British would have none of it. Their national
bulldog quality set its teeth on the old idea that had given
them their heavy, substantial, accurate watches, and hung
on grimly. The Swiss watches might be lighter and more
graceful but they questioned their lasting qualities. The
Swiss could make watches more beautifully, but the English
were suspicious of cheapness and declined to adopt the
new development.</p>

<p>Thus the English, who up to about 1840, had led the
world in the manufacture and sale of watches, began to fall
behind. The American watch industry was then in its infancy,
and the French industry had never been of any
great size. The Swiss gradually drew ahead until they practically
gained control of the world's market for watches.
Switzerland became known as the place from which
watches came, and, very much as "Havana" stands for a
fine cigar, so a fine watch was apt to be called a
"Geneva."</p>

<p class="center"><i>In former days, Swiss workmen made some particular watch
part in their own homes, while so-called "manufacturers" bought
the parts and "assembled" the watches.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>This, then, was the situation at about the middle of the
nineteenth century when watchmaking in America was beginning
to grow into a large industry. The French had always
made good watches and very beautiful and elaborate
ones too, but they never made very many. The English
were falling behind so far that it was said, in 1870, that
half the watchmakers' tools in England were in pawn. The
Swiss were in control of the business, making both the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>and the worst watches in the world and by far the greatest
number. Everywhere a good watch was still too costly to
be owned by anyone of moderate means, while cheap
watches were little more than toys which could not be
depended upon either to wear well or to keep good time.</p>

<p>In spite of all developments, therefore, there still remained
the need both for a high-grade watch at a reasonable
price and for a cheap watch that would be accurate
under rough usage. These things were genuinely necessary,
for the world was growing steadily away from the theory
of special privilege, and the requirements of the average
man were becoming more insistent.</p>

<p>From those early days, when the astrologers in Mesopotamia
had kept their knowledge a secret for themselves,
down through more than forty centuries, only a few had
possessed the means of accurately telling time; but now
had come the railroad, the telegraph, the modern factory,
the newspaper and many other developments which
speeded up the movements of humanity in the rush and
whirl of modern life until it had become absolutely necessary
that the means of measuring and performing those
movements in an economical manner should be within the
reach of every man.</p>

<p>It remains to be shown how American watchmaking discovered
this need and organized to meet it; how it found
and filled the gap that had been left in foreign watchmaking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>between high-priced watches that were good, and low-priced
watches that were not good; how it developed a
cheaper good watch and a better low-priced one than the
world had so far known; and how, in so doing, the American
industry has grown within the memory of living men
to such an extent as to take second place, and, in many
respects, first place in watchmaking throughout the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE<br />

<small><i>How An American Industry Came
On Horseback</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> last the clock industry came to America, and
it came on horseback. If you had been upon a
dusty country road in Connecticut about the
year 1800, you might have seen a plainly dressed young
man come riding along with a clock strapped to each side
of his saddle and a third fastened crosswise behind him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Eli Terry!" you might have heard some farmer
sing out, as the rider drew near.</p>

<p>"Hello, Silas," the other would call back; "don't you
think it's about time you bought a clock?"</p>

<p>"Can't afford it, Eli; it takes me a long time to make
forty dollars raising wheat."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you can't afford to be without one, Silas."
And, dismounting, he would unstrap one of the clocks and
bring it up to the stone wall. Then would follow the period
of bargaining, so dear to the shrewd, hard-headed sons of
Connecticut. Perhaps when young Terry climbed back into
the saddle and said "Gid-dap," one of his clocks would stay
behind with the farmer. Like most successful salesmen,
Terry was a close observer of human nature; he knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>habits once formed are hard to break. He discovered early
that if a prospective customer could be made to depend
upon a clock for telling time, the clock would soon sell itself.
One day, during a rain-storm, he sought refuge in a
farmer's home. He brought in with him one of his clocks
and placed it on the mantel over the fireplace, explaining
that he would like to leave it there, where it would not get
wet, while he continued on his journey.</p>

<p>"I'll be back for it in a few days," he said, as he waved
good-by.</p>

<p>When Terry returned, some days later, the farmer realized
that the clock, which he had first regarded as an extravagance
had somehow become a necessity, and, with
no urging on Terry's part, the sale was quickly completed.</p>

<p>Some of the original clocks are still running in the very
farmhouses where Eli Terry succeeded in selling them, and
where they have ticked off the minutes of American history
since the days of Adams and Jefferson. They were truly
remarkable clocks, in spite of the fact that their works
were cut out of hard wood with country tools, and put together
by a carpenter.</p>

<p>The first American clocks were made of wood, and most
of the early clockmakers were at first carpenters. We have
seen clockmakers developing from priests and astronomers
and blacksmiths and locksmiths and jewelers; but here is
a new gateway to the trade. This came about naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>enough in a country where the cheapest and most plentiful
material was wood, and where the carpenter and joiner was
accustomed to constructing every possible thing of it. Eli
Terry of Connecticut was one of the best known of these
early New England craftsmen. He was born in East
Windsor, just a few years before the Revolution. By the
time that he was twenty, he had made a few clocks, cutting
the wheels out of hard wood with saw and file, and making
wooden hands, dials, and cases. Then he moved to Plymouth,
not far from Waterbury, and set up a small shop
where he employed several workmen. They would make a
dozen or two at a time, entirely by hand. Then Terry
would take these out and sell them, sometimes as far as the
"new country" across the New York state line.</p>

<p>It took a long time to make a clock in this way, even for
fingers that were as clever as Terry's, and it is no wonder
that he was compelled to charge from twenty to forty dollars
apiece, a sum, which, by-the-way, would be equal to
at least four times as much to-day according to the difference
in the purchasing power of money. We must remember,
too, that a family then bought its clock as it bought a
wagon or a spinning-wheel, almost as a man buys his
house to-day. Certainly it was a far more important transaction
relatively than the purchase of a motor-car.</p>

<p>Probably, if one could have overheard some of these
roadside clock-sales it would have been noted that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>bargaining was not all upon one side, for there was not a
great deal of money in circulation, and people were very
apt to "swap." Likely as not, Terry would have to take his
payment in lumber, in clothing, or in some other commodity
and these, in turn, he would dispose of when an opportunity
presented itself. This was more or less the type of
the old horseback Yankee trader of the days when men
still remembered the Revolutionary War. These were
the days when a man who produced some one thing might
be forced, in order to realize on its value, to trade it for almost
anything else.</p>

<p>When we think of the early American timepiece, we generally
picture to ourselves the so-called "Grandfather's
Clock," the kind with the tall case which Longfellow wrote
about as standing on a turning in the stair and ticking
away: "Forever!" "Never!" "Never!" "Forever!" as it
marked the passage of the years. But Eli Terry, the first of
all American clock-makers, could not well carry such a big
contrivance with him on his horseback trips; therefore,
while he made the works for these clocks, he left it for
other people to construct the cases; the clocks which he
sold complete were those which could stand upon a shelf or
hang upon the wall.</p>

<p>After a time, his orders increased to a point where he
felt justified in moving into an old water-power mill and
rigging machinery to do some parts of the work. Thus we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>find machinery used in American clock-making almost from
the beginning of the industry. Terry thus was a real manufacturer;
he had grasped the importance of machine production
in contrast to hand-craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The move paid; it cut the cost of making nearly in half
and greatly increased the output. He now could afford to
sell his clocks more cheaply, and the business grew at once.
After a while he began to make clocks in lots of one or two
hundred and then, indeed, his neighbors shook their heads
gravely.</p>

<p>"You are losing your mind, Eli," they told him, in solemn
warning. "The first thing you know, the country will
be so full of clocks that there will be no market for them.
You are getting reckless and ruining your business."</p>

<p>But Eli Terry followed his own judgment instead of that
of the croakers; before he died he was making ten or
twelve thousand clocks in a year and was selling them too.
They brought him a fortune.</p>

<p>Thus was the industry of making timepieces born in
America. It began in New England, which is still the chief
center of manufacture, and it began with clocks, not
watches, for the simple reason that in those days, a watch
was a luxury whereas a clock was a necessity. Like the
watch industry in Switzerland, American clock-making
was an active business from the start, and, as we have seen,
the man with whom it started was a typically Yankee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>combination of ingenious mind, skilful fingers, and a
knack for business.</p>

<p>Of course, the conditions of life in America at that time
had a great deal to do with methods used in building up the
industry. Instead of a civilization centuries old that had
wealth, rank, royalty, and a complete organization of all
methods of living, here was a new country learning to do
things in its own way.</p>

<p>It is hard for us to imagine the conditions which prevailed
when our whole population was a mere fringe of
scattered settlements along the Atlantic seaboard; when
people made long trips on horseback or by stage-coach and
men wore powdered wigs and knickerbockers; when New
York was a small town on the lower end of Manhattan
Island, and Chicago had not even been dreamed of. Still,
it was necessary to tell time, and our thrifty ancestors
needs must watch the minutes in order to save them as
thriftily as they saved everything else. Not one person out
of hundreds, in a country where a living must be wrung
from the soil by means of hard work, could afford to own
anything so expensive as a watch, but every one felt it necessary
to have a clock, if possible, and it became one of
the greatest treasures of the home.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The First Yankee Clock Maker</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Eli Terry, America's first clock manufacturer, peddled his
wares among the shrewd, hard-headed sons of Connecticut.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>This, then, was the market in which Terry and those
who followed him had to sell. It was a market that could
not afford to pay for ornament but desired practical service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>at low cost. What was needed, therefore, was a clock that
would keep time and cost not a cent more than was absolutely
necessary. The American industry was forced to
start upon a basis entirely different from that of Europe.</p>

<p>As Eli Terry's business grew, he needed assistance, and
he secured the help of a young mechanic named Seth
Thomas from West Haven, and the two worked together
for some time.</p>

<p>The name of Seth Thomas has appeared upon so many
clock-dials that it is perhaps the best known name in all
American clock-making. He was a good mechanic, and a
good business man, and he had ideas of his own about increasing
trade. In the course of time, about the year 1800,
he and a man named Silas Hoadley bought the original
Terry factory in the old mill, and set up business for themselves.
Terry, however, established himself elsewhere and
continued to manufacture clocks.</p>

<p>Thus the industry was growing; there were now two
factories instead of one. Seth Thomas prospered by adopting
each popular fashion or improvement in clocks as it
came along and applying it upon as large a scale and as
honestly and well as could be done. He built up such a reputation
that even to-day, while the name of Seth Thomas
on a clock face does not suggest any particular form or
style of clock, it is associated with good time keeping and
honest workmanship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>The third of the famous old New England clock-makers
was Chauncey Jerome. He was a man younger than Terry
and Thomas by nearly a generation. Like both of his predecessors
he was brought up to the carpenter's trade, and
like both of them he was a born New England trader. But
of the three, Jerome was perhaps most the inventor and
least the man of business. As a boy, he worked for Seth
Thomas when Thomas was still building barns and houses.
He worked for Eli Terry in the old shop at Plymouth.
Then, after a period of soldiering in the War of 1812, he
went back to clock-making, sometimes manufacturing by
himself and sometimes associated with one or the other of
the two older men, or in other firms and enterprises too
numerous to follow. Always he seems to have been somewhat
of a rolling stone, although in his time he gathered as
much moss as the best of them: always he was inclined to
experiment with new ideas.</p>

<p>Jerome's carpentering skill caused him to be first interested
in the making of cases, and most of the familiar
forms of old American clocks—the square clock with pillars
at the corners and a scroll top, the clock with a mirror
underneath the dial and the like, were designed by Terry
and Jerome between them. Later on, when the establishment
of brass foundries in Waterbury and Bristol had
enabled American makers to construct their work of brass
instead of wood, Jerome worked out a design for a brass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>one-day timepiece in a wooden case, small enough for
easy transportation, and cheaper than any clock ever
made up to that time. Its price at first, near the place of
manufacture, was only five or six dollars, but afterwards
this was reduced.</p>

<p>This low-priced clock was as remarkable in its way as
was the dollar watch, which it foreshadowed. And like the
watch, it would not have been possible except through
machine work and quantity production. It was a success at
once and Jerome's business rapidly increased. In 1840, he
was established in Bristol, turning out the new clocks by
the thousand, and rapidly making a fortune. A year or two
later, he decided to send a consignment of them to England.</p>

<p>Again, people shook their heads and prophesied failure.
"You're losing your mind, Chauncey," they told him as
they had told Eli Terry before him.</p>

<p>The older wooden movements could not, of course, endure
a sea voyage without swelling and becoming useless.
A brass movement could, of course, be sent anywhere, and
some of the more expensive ones had been shipped to all
parts of the country, yet it seemed absurd enough to send
American clocks to England where labor was so cheap—to
England, which was then the chief clockmaker of the
world. Nevertheless, Jerome persevered, and his son sailed
for London with a cargo of the cheap clocks. At first, the
English trade would have none of them. No clock so cheap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>could possibly be good, they said, and Connecticut was the
home of "the wooden nutmegs." It was only after great
difficulty that they were introduced. Young Jerome got rid
of the first few by leaving them about in retail stores, asking
no payment for them until sold.</p>

<p>The enterprise was saved by an event which was a joke
in itself. The English revenue law at that time permitted
the owner of imported goods to fix their taxable value.
But the government could take any such property upon
payment of a sum ten per cent greater than the owner's
valuation. Jerome's clocks were valued at their wholesale
price, and were presently seized by the customs officials
on the ground that this valuation was fraudulently low.</p>

<p>The elder Jerome chuckled upon learning of this. He was
well satisfied to have closed out his first cargo at ten per
cent profit, and at once sent over another shipment
which was taken over by the customs as promptly as the
first. But by the time the third consignment arrived,
enough of the clocks had been sold to establish a demand
for them among the retailers, and the officials finally conceded
that the low price might be a reasonable one after all.</p>

<p>Jerome was not at the height of his prosperity. He had
the largest and probably the most profitable clock business
in the country; and, in the few years following, his product
was exported to all parts of the world. Then the Bristol
factory burned down and he moved to New Haven, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>the Jerome Manufacturing Company enjoyed a brief
period of great success. The business was constantly extended,
and the wholesale price of the cheap brass clocks
was brought as low as seventy-five cents. This figure seems
almost impossibly low for the time, but the authority for it
is Jerome's own autobiography.</p>

<p>A few years before the Civil War, the Jerome Company
failed and, curiously enough, this failure came about
through its connection with that usually successful man,
P. T. Barnum, the famous showman. The story is too much
complicated to be given here in detail, but it seems that
Barnum had become heavily interested in a smaller clock
company, which was merged with the Jerome concern.
The overvaluation of its stock, combined with mismanagement
and speculation among the officials of the Jerome
Company, served to drive the whole business into bankruptcy.
Barnum lost heavily, and it took him years to clear
up his obligations. Jerome never did recover from it; after
some years of failing power in the employ of other manufacturers,
he died in comparative poverty.</p>

<p>His long and eventful life spans the whole growth of the
American clock business from the days of Eli Terry and his
handsawed wooden movements down to the maturity of
the modern business supplying, by factory methods and
the use of specialized machinery, millions of clocks to all
parts of the world. He had made clocks all over Connecticut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>in Plymouth, Farmington, Bristol, New Haven and
Waterbury, as well as in Massachusetts and, for a time, in
South Carolina and Virginia. He had worked with his
hands for Terry and Seth Thomas at the old wooden wheels
and veneered cases, which were peddled about the country
and sold for thirty or forty dollars each to be the treasured
timekeepers of many households. And he had headed a
modern factory, turning out dollar clocks by the tens of
thousands.</p>

<p>It is said that a child in the first few years of its life lives
briefly through the whole evolution of civilized mankind.
That "infant industry," American clock-making, likewise,
in the short space of fifty years passed through most of the
steps of the whole growth of time-recording between the
Middle Ages and our own era. This country stands now
among the leading clock-making nations of the world; its
product is famous in every land and a timepiece from
Waterbury or New Haven may mark the minutes in the
town from which Gerbert was banished for sorcery because
he made a time-machine, or in that land between the rivers
where the Babylonians first looked out upon the stars.</p>

<p>Most of the American clocks are still made in Connecticut;
in fact, more than eighty per cent of the whole world's
supply (excluding the German) comes from the Naugatuck
Valley. The New Haven Clock Company, which is the
successor of the Jerome Company, is to-day one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>largest. As far back as 1860, it was producing some two
hundred thousand clocks a year. The Seth Thomas Company
and others of the historic concerns are still at work in
various portions of the state. And the Benedict &amp; Burnham
Company, with which, at one time, Chauncey Jerome was
associated, became the Waterbury Clock Company, now
regarded as the largest clock producer, and of which we
shall hear more later on.</p>

<p>The key-note of the whole development was that new
principle which American invention, prompted and
stimulated by the pressing necessities of a new nation,
brought into the business of time-recording—the principle
of marvelously cheapening production-costs without loss
of efficiency, through the systematic employment of
machinery on a large scale.</p>

<p>As long as the inventive brains and the technical knowledge
of the old-time craftsman found expression only
through his own fingers, the results would be limited to
his individual production, and the costs would be proportionately
high. When, however, the master mind was able
to operate through rows of machines, each under the
supervision of a mechanic trained to its particular
function, his inventive genius was provided with ten thousand
hands and a hundred thousand fingers. Furthermore,
the production gained in quality as well as in quantity,
because of specialization, all the time its costs were in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>process of reduction. This, perhaps, has been America's
chief contribution, not only to the making of timepieces,
but, also to the world's industry in general.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br />

<small><i>America Learns to Make Watches</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">While</span> Eli Terry was sawing wood for his curious
clocks back in the early days of the nineteenth
century, Luther Goddard, America's
first watch-manufacturer, was preaching the Gospel to the
town and country-folk in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Between sermons he repaired watches.</p>

<p>Although we can find no record of such a meeting, it is
easy to imagine that while plodding along some dusty
country road Preacher Goddard met Terry jogging along
with his cumbersome wooden clocks hanging from his
saddle. The thought may have come to the minister-mechanic
that it would be much easier to peddle watches
than clocks.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the prompting, we find, as a
matter of record, that, in the year 1809, while Terry was
making and peddling his clocks, Luther Goddard set up a
small watch-making shop in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts,
the place of his birth. He employed watch-makers who had
learned their trade in England. At that time, there was a
law in force which prohibited the importation of foreign-made
watches into America and this gave Goddard his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>chance. But in 1815, when the law was repealed and the
American market was quickly flooded with cheaper, if not
better watches from abroad, he was forced to retire from
the field. During those few years he had produced about
five hundred watches.</p>

<p>Discouraged by his venture into worldly affairs, he
turned again to his former occupation of preacher and
evangelist, and consoled himself with the remark that he
"had here a profession high above his secular vocation."
In those days, protection and free trade had not yet become
the rival rallying cries of two great political parties;
otherwise we might have found this early manufacturer
entering politics instead of the pulpit. While he is credited
with manufacturing the first American watches, however,
it is doubtful whether he and his workmen really did more
than to assemble imported parts.</p>

<p>More than twenty years now passed before another effort
was made to produce watches in America—this time
by two brothers—Henry and James F. Pitkin of Hartford,
Connecticut. In 1838, they brought out a watch, most of
the parts of which were made by machinery, but it proved
more or less a failure. After a brief struggle, they gave up
in discouragement. Henry Pitkin died in 1845, and his
brother, a few years later.</p>

<p>While the Pitkin Brothers were struggling with their
problem in Hartford, Jacob D. Custer of Norristown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Pennsylvania, was engaged in a similar task. He succeeded
in making a few watches between 1840 and 1845, thus
gaining his niche in history as the third American watch
manufacturer.</p>

<p>But all of these were merely forerunners, for now there
stepped upon the stage a young man whose ability and
perseverance were destined to launch American watch-making
fairly upon its way. This young man was born in
Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1813, and his name was
Edward Howard; it was born in him to be an inventive and
ingenious craftsman and to feel toward the mechanism of
time-keeping the devotion of an artist to his art. At the
age of sixteen, he was apprenticed to Aaron Willard, Jr.,
of Roxbury, one of the cleverest clock-makers of his time.</p>

<p>Young Howard took to clock-making as naturally as a
Gloucester man takes to the sea. Some of the clocks he then
made are still ticking as vigorously as ever. Having presently
learned all he cared to know about clock-making, he
cast about for other fields of action. His bent, as he himself
said, "was all for the finer and more delicate mechanism,"
and it was natural that these qualities of the watch should
absorb his interest. It was equally natural, since he was an
American clock-maker at a time when that trade was being
revolutionized by machine-work, that he should dream of
applying such methods to the watch.</p>

<p>"One difficulty I found," he is quoted as saying, "was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>that watch-making did not exist in the United States as an
industry. There were watchmakers, so-called, at that time,
and there are great numbers of the same kind now, but
they never made a watch; their business being only to clean
and repair. I knew from experience that there was no
proper system employed in making watches. The work
was all done by hand. Now, hand-work is superior in
many of the arts because it allows variation according to
the individuality of the worker. But in the exquisitely fine
wheels and screws and pinions that make up the parts of a
watch, the less variation the better. Some of these parts
are so fine as to be almost invisible to the naked eye. A variation
of one five-thousandths of an inch would throw the
watch out altogether, or make it useless as a timepiece. As
I say, all of these minute parts were laboriously cut and
filed out by hand, so it will readily be understood that in
watches purporting to be of the same size and of the same
makers, there are no two alike, and there was no interchangeability
of parts. Consequently it was 'cut and try'.
A great deal of time was wasted and many imperfections
resulted."</p>

<p>Howard's ambition lay in the production of a perfect
watch for its own sake; and he wanted to make it by machinery,
believing that, in that way, it could be made most
perfectly. Other people had thought of the same thing.
Pitkin had attempted it, and there had been some experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>of like nature in Switzerland. But the man who loves
his work as Howard did will succeed in anything short of
the impossible, because neither time nor labor, neither
failure nor discouragement, matter at all to him as against
the hope of making his dream come true.</p>

<p>As Howard was emerging into young manhood, the
great period of American invention was rapidly developing.
Morse was struggling with the electric telegraph which
he invented and perfected in 1835, and Goodyear was busy
with machinery and processes for enabling rubber to be
used commercially, thus laying the foundation for one of
the greatest American industries of to-day. Ingenuity was
in the air and invention was conquering realms that had
been believed beyond reach.</p>

<p>When people told Howard that it was absurd to think
of improving upon the manual skill of centuries, he answered
that he expected to make his machinery by hand.
And when they said that a machine for watch-making
would be more wonderful than the watch itself, he only
laughed and agreed that this might be so.</p>

<p>To-day, we are familiar with such phrases as "standardized
parts" and "quantity production," which explain to
us how it is possible for a single factory to produce millions
of watches in a year, or for another kind of plant to turn
out half a million automobiles in a like period. The way in
which "quantity production" came about is curiously interesting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Watch-making received one of its greatest impulses
from a famous American inventor who probably
would have been amazed had anyone told him that his
idea upon quite another subject would some day help to
put watches into millions of pockets.</p>

<p>There is no particular connection between a cotton-gin
and the "quantity production" of watches, but it is interesting
to know that the same ingenious brain which designed
the one also unconsciously suggested the other. Late
in the eighteenth century, Eli Whitney gained lasting
fame as the inventor of a machine which would automatically
separate the seeds from the fiber of crude cotton—a
machine which revolutionized the cotton industry of the
south.</p>

<p>In 1798, Whitney secured a contract to manufacture
rifles for the government. He decided that they could be
made much more rapidly and cheaply if he could find some
way to produce all the separate parts in large quantities by
machinery, and then merely assemble the various parts into
the completed weapon. The inventive mind which was
capable of devising the cotton-gin found this new problem
to be comparatively simple, and it was not long before
Whitney was making thousands of rifles from machine-made
"standardized parts," where only one could be made
before. Half a century later his machinery was still turning
out rifles parts in the great arsenal at Springfield, Massachusetts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>and it was not until this period that it exerted a
distinct influence upon watch-making.</p>

<p>While Howard in Roxbury was dreaming of producing
watches by machinery, another young man—Aaron L.
Dennison, of Boston—was also obsessed with the same
dream and grappling with the same problem. It is therefore
not strange that the paths of these two soon crossed.
Born in Freeport, Maine, 1812, Dennison was just a year
older than Howard. He was an expert watch-repairer and
watch-assembler, having learned his craft among the Swiss
and the English workmen in New York and Boston. The
year 1845 found him conducting a small watch and jewelry
business in Boston.</p>

<p>Some few years earlier, Dennison had visited friends in
Springfield, Massachusetts, and while there he was taken
to one of the interesting show-places of the town—the
Springfield Arsenal. As he made his slow progress through
the great rifle factory, he marveled at the wonderful machinery
and the system which had originated in the brain
of Eli Whitney nearly half a century before; Whitney was
dead and gone, but his works still lived.</p>

<p>Dennison returned to Boston, fired with an ambition to
apply the Whitney system and methods of rifle-making to
the manufacture of watches. He brooded over the scheme
for years, constructing a pasteboard model of his imaginary
watch factory and planning in detail its organization.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>Then occurred a meeting that was to make history—a
meeting marking the first step in founding a great American
industry and wresting from Europe and Great Britain
the watch-making monopoly which they had continuously
held since the days of the "Nuremburg Egg." Dennison
met Howard, and the contact of the two minds was like the
meeting of flint and steel. Dennison shared Howard's belief
that watch-parts could be made better and more accurately
by the use of machines. He had the watch-making
experience and Howard the mechanical skill to design the
new machinery. One may imagine how the two young men
inspired each other. They had the ideas; all they now
needed was the capital and this was supplied in 1848 by
Mr. Samuel Curtis, who backed them to the extent of
twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Dennison immediately went abroad to study methods in
England and Switzerland and came back more than ever
convinced of the soundness of their own ideas.</p>

<p>"I have examined," said he, "watches made by a man
whose reputation at this moment is far beyond that of any
other watchmaker in Great Britain and have found in
them such workmanship as I should blush to have it supposed
had passed from under my hands in our own lower
grade of work. Of course I do not mean to say that there
is not work in these watches of the highest grade possible,
but errors do creep in and are allowed to pass the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>competent examiners. And it needs but slight acquaintance
with our art to discover that the lower grade of
foreign watches are hardly as mechanically correct in their
construction as a common wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>On his return, in 1850, he and Howard established themselves
in a small factory in Roxbury, under the name of the
American Horologe Company. And that little factory was
the foundation of what is now the great establishment of
the Waltham Watch Company, the first and hence the
oldest watch company in America, and the parent concern
of most of the rest.</p>

<p>It was perhaps at this time that an employee, one P. S.
Bartlett, returned to his home town on a visit and was
asked by his old neighbors what he had been doing.</p>

<p>"I am working," said he, "for a company which makes
seven complete watches in a day." Great was the merriment
at this reply. "Why, where on earth could you <em>sell</em>
seven watches a day?" they shouted.</p>

<p>With the advent of the factory, the real troubles of
Dennison and Howard began. It is worth while to glance
for a moment at the problem which lay before them, if only
to appreciate its difficulty. The old plan was to have a
model watch made by hand by a master workman. This
watch was then taken apart and its separate parts distributed
for reproduction by a multitude of specialized
workers involving perhaps some forty or fifty minor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>trades. These parts, hand-made after a hand-made model,
were then returned to the expert who assembled and adjusted
them. At the worst, this resulted in gross error; at
the best, in individual variation. A part from one watch
could not be expected to fit and work accurately in another,
although the two were supposed to be alike in all
their parts.</p>

<p>The new idea was first to lay out the whole design on
paper and then to make the various parts by machinery
according to the exact design. It was supposed that a machine
making one part would duplicate that part repeatedly
without variation; that in so far as the machines
themselves were accurate, the parts produced would necessarily
be interchangeable; that any set of parts could
therefore be assembled without fitting or alteration. The
finished watch, it was assumed, would require adjustment
only. Theoretically, this idea was correct; practically, it
could not be perfectly carried out, and the results did not
fulfil the hopes of the manufacturers. In the first place,
there were not in existence any machines of the required
delicacy and precision; every one must first be invented,
then designed, then made, and finally adjusted for practical
operation. Even so, and notwithstanding the great
mechanical achievements of the Waltham Company, the
results never succeeded in realizing the dreams of Howard
and Dennison, of absolute interchangeability of parts. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>remained for the Ingersoll organization, many years later,
to develop such a factory system.</p>

<p>Before Howard and Dennison could make a single
watch, therefore, they had to invent all the mechanism,
and themselves build and install every invention. Moreover,
several of the processes had to be worked out from
the ground up. There was nobody in America who understood
watch-gilding, for example, or who could make dials
or jewels.</p>

<p>Thus they set to work developing the machinery as fast
as they could do so, and imported such parts as they themselves
could not yet make. It was a staggering task and a
discouraging devourer of capital. "I do not think," said
Dennison many years later, "there were seven times in the
seven years we were together that we had money enough to
pay all our employees at the time their wages were due.
Very often we would find ourselves without any cash on
hand, but Mr. Howard would manage some way to produce
enough to tide over with."</p>

<p>The two men made a perfect team, eager to give each
other credit, and each having unbounded loyalty and confidence
in the other and in their enterprise. But, curiously
enough, it was Howard, the artist and dreamer, who seems
to have developed into the business man of the two, in addition
to being the inventor and engineer, whereas Dennison,
the expert watch-repairer, became the designer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>originator of plans. It was said of him long afterward that
there was probably never an idea in American watch-making
that had not at some time passed through Mr.
Dennison's resourceful mind. He is known to many as the
"Father of the American Watch Industry," although he insisted
that Howard deserved the title as much if not more
than he. Dennison schemed out what was to be done, while
Howard found the money and invented the machinery
with which to do it.</p>

<p>Their first model, an eight-day watch, was Dennison's
idea. It was found to be impracticable and was soon abandoned
in favor of a one-day model. The name of the company
had to be changed, because it did not find favor with
some of the English firms from whom they bought certain
parts. They called it the "Warren Manufacturing Company"
for a time, and their first few watches were marked
with this name. Later on, they moved to a new factory at
Waltham and incorporated under the name of the Waltham
Improvement Company. It was while the act for its
incorporation was before the Massachusetts legislature
that some wag there produced the couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"<i>A Waltham' 'patent' watch, which ere it goes</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>Besides the 'hands' must have the 'ayes' and 'noes.</i>"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>All this time, the tools and machinery were giving trouble.
There were innumerable difficulties. For example, New
England workmen objected to cutting the pinion-leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>because they were shaped like a bishop's miter. And financial
pressure was always upon them. The building was one
of the earliest attempts at concrete construction, and was
far from stable in stormy weather. Mr. Hull, afterward
foreman in the dial-room, said: "Often in those days we
would jump from our stools when we felt something jar,
for fear the building would fall down. Somehow, it never
did."</p>

<p>In 1854 the name was changed again, this time to the
American Watch Company. Incidentally, Mr. Dennison
took his place among the large and honorable company of
inventors who have been called insane. He earned that title
by saying that they would eventually make as many as
fifty watches a day. The company now makes between two
thousand and three thousand a day.</p>

<p>Just as they were on the point of a richly deserved success,
the panic of 1857 drove the young company into
bankruptcy. The plant was purchased by Royal E. Robbins,
of the firm of Robbins &amp; Appleton, watch importers.
Howard went back to the old factory at Roxbury, taking
with him a few trained workmen, and patiently started all
over again. He succeeded, at last, in producing really fine
watches, although in small numbers; and his new business,
as we shall see later, developed into the E. Howard Clock
Company, and practically abandoned the manufacture of
watches. Meanwhile, the Waltham factory, under good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>business management and with Dennison as its superintendent,
was safely steered past the financial rocks and shoals
of the period, and began gradually to reap the reward of
its less fortunate early efforts.</p>

<p>It was the Civil War, with its great military demand for
watches, which first set the Waltham Company squarely
upon its feet by justifying quantity production. A dividend
of five per cent was declared in 1860; and one of one
hundred and fifty per cent in 1866, the short-lived Nashua
Watch Company having meanwhile been absorbed. Since
that date its name has been twice changed—first, to the
American Waltham Watch Company, and then to the
Waltham Watch Company, which is now its title.</p>

<p>At the present day, the Waltham Company employs
nearly four thousand people and produces about sixty-eight
thousand complete watch-movements a month, or
over three-quarters of a million a year.</p>

<p>This output is made possible only through the extensive
employment of automatic machines, all of which have been
invented and manufactured at the Waltham factory.
Even now it is not possible to buy watch-making machinery
ready-made in the open market; it is all "special" work,
designed and often built by the watch manufacturers
themselves. And the development of this great industry,
employing, at first, crude devices operated for the most
part by hand-power, to the complex automatic mechanism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>which seems to act almost with human intelligence, has
been a marvelous achievement.</p>

<p>The company now makes ten different sizes of regular
movements, in more than a hundred different grades and
styles. Of these every part is made in the Waltham factory.
It was the first establishment in the world in which
all parts of a watch were made by machinery and under
the same roof. And its success revolutionized the methods
of watch-making not only in America but, to a less degree,
in all parts of the world. A prominent London watchmaker
who went through the plant in the early period of
its success said to his colleagues: "On leaving the factory,
I felt that the manufacture of watches on the old plan
was gone." And the name passed into literature when
Emerson, describing a successful type of man, said, "He
is put together like a Waltham watch."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> of those mental marvels who can play fifteen
simultaneous games of chess, blindfolded, might
be able to form a complete idea of the American
watch-making industry in the years that followed the Civil
War; all that the ordinary mind can gain is a bewildering
impression of change and confusion, with companies
springing up, and merging or disappearing, all over the
industrial map. Inventions were as thick as blackberries in
August and, to investors, as thorny as their stems. Countless
revolutionary ideas in watch-making revolved briefly—few
evolved, and capitalists, large and small, learned the
sobering lessons of experience, as capitalists ever have and
ever will.</p>

seven watches a day, his friends laughed, "Why, where could
you <span class="smcap lowercase">SELL</span> seven watches a day?"</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>With it all, certain points seem to stand out as clearly
defined—among them the fact that watch-production appealed
strongly to the public mind at a time when the
nation, galvanized into intense activity by the great conflict,
was entering an era of extraordinary self-organization.
This is, of course, significant. The nation's time as
well as its forests, mines, and other resources, must be a
factor in the growth of public wealth, and this could not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>unless it were widely and accurately measured, which, in
turn, implied the universal use of the watch.</p>

<p>The later history of American watch-making is, therefore,
a story of the formation of many companies, the
failure of most, and survival in the case of comparatively
few. In the sense of being founded by men whose experience
had been gained at Waltham, the Waltham Company
was more or less the parent of the majority. Of the failures,
it may roughly and broadly be stated that the general
trouble was most often a lack of cooperation between technical
watch-making skill and business management.</p>

<p>Of the occasional successes due, on the other hand, to
perfect harmony between these two factors, the Elgin National
Watch Company, established at Elgin, Illinois, in
1864, was one of the first. Its officials and promoters were
not watchmakers but business men—a group of Western
capitalists who organized the company at the suggestion of
a few trained men from Waltham, to whose technical experience
and knowledge they gave entire liberty of action
from the first. This combination of Western enterprise and
Eastern mechanical skill was a great and immediate success.
Within six years from its incorporation, the Elgin
Company had built its factory, designed and made its own
machinery, and marketed forty-two thousand watches. It
is said to be the only American watch company which has
paid dividends from the beginning. And yet this achievement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>cannot be traced to anything strikingly distinctive
either in the policy or in the product. It was a case of doing
rapidly and easily, with vast previous experience to build
upon, what the parent company had so long strived to accomplish,
and of doing this honestly and well. In a small
way, it was like the rapid growth of democratic principles
in America, having, as it were, the British commonwealth
of a thousand years on which to base itself.</p>

<p>The period of the development of American watch-making
was also the period of the rapid and enormous expansion
of railroads. The two were naturally related, in that
railroading demands the constant use of a great number of
watches, while its progress in punctuality and speed is in
direct proportion to the supply of reliable timekeepers. Precision
is here the great essential; every passenger must have
the means of being on hand in time in order not to miss his
train. But what is of far greater importance, railroad men
must know and keep the exact time not alone for their own
protection but in order that they may protect and safeguard
the lives of those who are entrusted to their care.</p>

<p>Most of our great inventions and improvements can be
traced to some pressing human need. Many of them, unfortunately,
are delayed until some great catastrophe
shows the need. It required a disastrous wreck to bring
home to the railroads and make clear the necessity for absolute
accuracy in the timepieces of their employees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>In the year 1891 two trains on the Lake Shore Railroad
met in head-on collision near Kipton, Ohio, killing the two
engineers and several railway mail-clerks. In the investigation
which followed, it was disclosed that the watches of
the engineers differed by four minutes. The watch which
was at fault had always been accurate and so its owner
took it for granted that it always would be. But tiny particles
of dust and soot find ways of seeping into the most
carefully protected works of a watch, and every watch
should be examined and cleaned occasionally. So it was
with the engineer's watch. A speck of coal dust, perhaps,
had caused his watch to stop for a few minutes and then
the jolting of the engine had probably started it running
again. That little speck of dust and those few lost minutes
cost human lives.</p>

<p>This wreck occurred not many miles from Cleveland,
Ohio, then and now the home of Webb C. Ball, a jeweler,
who as a watch expert, was a witness in the investigation
which followed. His interest thus aroused, he worked out a
plan which provided for a rigid and continuous system of
railroad watch inspection. The plan which he then proposed
is now in operation on practically every railroad in
the country.</p>

<p>A railroad watch must keep accurate time within thirty
seconds a week, and is likely to be condemned if its variation
exceeds that amount in a month; it must conform to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>certain specifications of design and workmanship which are
only put into movements of a fairly high grade. And the
railroad man must provide himself with such a timepiece
and maintain it in proper condition, subject to frequent
and regular inspection by the railroad's official inspector.
There is thus a compulsory demand for watches of a definite
quality and performance at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Expressly to meet this, the Hamilton Watch Company,
of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was organized in 1892, the
year after the wreck which started this reform. This company
therefore represents an enterprise founded for a
specific purpose and concentrating upon a certain specialized
demand, although this does not mean that it is the
only company which caters to the needs of the railroad
man. All of the great companies produce timekeepers of the
highest precision for railroad use, but the Hamilton Company
has devoted itself more particularly to supplying
this one field.</p>

<p>The Gruen Watch Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio, is
typical of still another line of endeavor—the beautifying
and refining of watch-cases and watch-works. Its founder,
Dietrich Gruen, was a Swiss master watchmaker. He came
to America, as a young man, in 1876, married here, and
established the international industry which bears his
name. It might be said that his watch is not an American
product, as the Gruen movements are made at Madre-Biel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>in Switzerland, and then sent over to America to be
cased, adjusted, and marketed. Perhaps the most notable
contribution of this company to the watchmaking industry
was to inaugurate the modern thin type of watch. This was
evolved by Frederick, the son of Dietrich Gruen, and was
made possible by the inverting of the third wheel of the
watch, so that the whole train runs in much less space than
was previously required.</p>

<p>These four companies are by no means the only successful
ones, but they do typify the general trend of development
of the American watch industry from 1850 until near
the end of the nineteenth century, when a new and even
greater era in the history of timekeeping was inaugurated.
The story of this development will be considered in later
chapters. In the period then closed, however, the ideal of
Dennison and Howard, which most people then regarded
as an impossibility, was realized to a degree which they
themselves would never have thought possible. Dennison
died in 1898 and Howard in 1904.</p>

<p>Although watch-making is the creation of European
genius and was rooted in European experience, with
boundless capital at its command and carried on in communities
trained for generations in the craft, it is in this
country that it has been brought to its fullest modern development.
The census figures, while incomplete and somewhat
misleading, are expressive of the amount of growth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>and of its nature. According to these figures there were in
1869 thirty-seven watch companies in the United States,
employing eighteen hundred and sixteen wage earners, or
an average of less than fifty workmen; and their combined
product was valued at less than three million dollars.
In 1914, the last normal year before the Great War, there
were but fifteen such companies; the law of the survival of
the fittest had been operating. But these fifteen employed
an average of over eight hundred people, or twelve thousand
three hundred and ninety in all, and the combined
value of their product was stated as over fourteen million
dollars. These figures are far below reality in that they do
not include the large volume of watches produced in clock
factories.</p>

<p>American watch-making is typical of the difference between
the American and European industry in the nineteenth
century. Here a complete watch is produced in one
factory, while in England, Switzerland and France most
establishments specialize in the manufacture of particular
parts and these parts are then assembled in other factories.
Some fifty different trades there are working separately to
produce the parts. And the manufacturer, whose work is
chiefly that of finishing and assembling, takes a large profit
for inspection and for the prestige of his name.</p>

<p>By the American system, a thousand watches are produced
proportionately more cheaply than a dozen; and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>thousand of uniform model more cheaply than a like number
of various sizes and designs. Automatic machines tend
to economy of labor and uniformity of excellence. The
saving begins with the cost of material and ends with the
ease and quickness of repairs due to the standardization of
parts.</p>

<p>Lord Grimthorpe said: "There can be no doubt that this
is the best as well as the cheapest way of making machines
which require precision. Although labor is dearer in America
than here, their machinery enables them to undersell
English watches of the same quality."</p>

<p>It now remained for American ingenuity and enterprise
to level the ramparts of special privilege in the world of
time-telling by producing an accurate and practical watch
in sufficient quantity and at a price so low as to place it
within the reach of all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN<br />

<small>"<i>The Watch That Wound Forever</i>"</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> most important development in any affair is
naturally the one which concerns the greatest
number of people. In the United States, it is the
people who count and nothing can be considered wholly
American which does not concern the mass of the population.
We have already seen how watch-movements were
brought to a high degree of accuracy, and have followed
some of the steps by which the industry was developed in
the United States, but there remained one great step to be
taken, and that was the putting of an accurate watch within
the financial reach of almost every person. The way
in which this was brought about was thoroughly American.</p>

<p>In 1875, Jason R. Hopkins, of Washington, D. C., after
many months of patient labor, perfected the model of a
watch which he thought could be constructed in quantities
for fifty cents each. He secured a patent on his model, and
with Edward A. Locke, of Boston, and W. D. Colt, of
Washington, sought to interest the Benedict &amp; Burnham
Manufacturing Company, of Waterbury, Connecticut, in
its manufacture.</p>

<p>Failing in this, Locke abandoned further effort so far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>the Hopkins' model was concerned. Hopkins, however,
continued, and finally succeeded in enlisting the active
support and financial resources of W. B. Fowle, a gentleman
of wealth and leisure, who owned a fine estate at
Auburndale, Massachusetts. This led to the formation of
the Auburndale Watch Company. Within a few years,
Fowle had sunk his entire fortune of more than $250,000
in the enterprise, and the Hopkins watch had proved a
complete failure. In 1883 both Fowle and the Watch
Company made assignments.</p>

<p>There are many who still remember the great Centennial
Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876, celebrating the one
hundredth anniversary of the declaration of American
Independence. Those who were there may recall the interesting
exhibit of a huge steam-engine—at least, it seemed
huge at that time—and, in a glass case near by, a tiny
engine—so tiny that it could be completely covered by a
small thimble. This midget steam engine, with its boiler,
governor, and pumps, was just as complete in all of its
parts as was the big engine. Three drops of water would fill
its boiler. It was a striking example of mechanical skill and
fineness of workmanship, for it had been made under a
watchmaker's microscope with jeweler's tools.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about this little engine was
that, unknown to its designer, it heralded the dawn of Democracy
in the Kingdom of Time-telling, just as it then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>was helping to celebrate the birth of American freedom. In
the spring of 1877, Edward A. Locke, of Boston, who
two years before, as we have seen, had been interested in
the Hopkins' watch, visited the neighboring city of Worcester,
and while strolling along the main street, in a leisurely
manner, he chanced to glance in the window of a
watch-repairer's shop. There he saw the tiny engine which
had excited so much wonder and admiration at the Philadelphia
exposition the year before.</p>

<p>For many months, Locke and his friend George Merritt,
of Brooklyn, New York, had been thinking and dreaming
of the possibility of supplying the long-felt and rapidly-growing
need for a low-priced watch—a pocket-timepiece
that could be sold for three or four dollars. The cheapest
watch in America at that time cost ten or twelve. They had
searched in vain for a watchmaker who was ingenious or
courageous enough, or both, to attempt the making of such
a timepiece.</p>

<p>Fascinated by the marvelous little engine, Locke stepped
into the shop and spoke to the lone workman at the bench
near the window. This obscure and humble watch repairer
was D. A. A. Buck, the proprietor of the shop and designer
of the engine, who was soon to gain renown as the
inventor of the famous Waterbury watch.</p>

<p>For the sum of one hundred dollars Buck agreed to study
the problem, and, if possible, design for Locke a watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>which would meet his requirements. Day and night, for
many weeks, he labored at this task, and finally submitted
a model. It was not satisfactory.</p>

<p>Worn by his labors and disappointed by his failure, he
fell ill. Some days later, Mrs. Buck sought out Locke and
joyfully told him that her husband had worked out a new
design which he believed would correct the defects of the
former model and that, as soon as he recovered, he would
begin work upon it. Within a few months he had completed
a second model. This time he was successful.</p>

<p>Then began the struggle of Locke and his associates to
interest capital in the new enterprise. Most of the preliminary
funds and factory space were provided by the
Benedict &amp; Burnham Manufacturing Company, a brass
manufacturing concern at Waterbury, Connecticut, and
the predecessor of the present Waterbury Clock Company.
Thus the new watch came to be known as the <i>Waterbury</i>.</p>

<p>Within the next twenty-eight months many thousands
of dollars had been raised and expended before a single
watch could be turned out for sale. It was not until 1880
that the Waterbury Watch Company was finally incorporated
and ready for business. Then the factory proudly
produced its first thousand watches. They were perfectly
good-looking watches, but they had one important weakness—they
would not run, because, as it was found, the
sheets of brass used in stamping out the wheels had an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>unfortunate grain, and the wheels would not remain true.
Another thousand were made with this defect corrected.
This time most of the watches would keep time, but there
still was a large percentage of "stoppers." After more
study, experiment, and expense, the product was improved
until only about ten per cent of the watches refused to run,
and the Waterbury watch was really on the market.</p>

<p>It was a wonderfully simple piece of mechanism, very
different from the ordinary watch. The whole works turned
round inside of the case once every hour, carrying the hour-hand
with them. The mainspring was coiled round the
outside of the movement, so that the case formed a barrel,
and was wound by the stem. It had the old duplex escapement
of the days of Tompion and the dial was printed on
paper, covered with celluloid and glued to the plate. It
had only fifty-eight parts, kept time surprisingly well, was
not much to look at, but was sold at the then unheard-of
low price of four dollars.</p>

<p>It was put on the market with real Yankee ingenuity.
Some of us remember when Waterbury watches were given
away with suits of clothes, and the pride with which, as
youngsters, we exhibited our first watches thus obtained
to our playmates who were less fortunate. The nine-foot
mainspring required unlimited winding, which was one of
its chief joys, and our friends often solicited the privilege
of helping in the operation. Some of the more ingenious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>among us held the corrugated stem against the side of a
fence and made the watch wind itself by running along the
fence's length, while other children looked on enviously.</p>

<p>In spite of the disadvantage of the time necessary for
winding, perhaps in part because of it, the Waterbury
watch became famous the world over and reached a very
large sale for its day. It was more or less of a freak contrivance.
People spoke of it with a smile. Minstrels opened
their performances by saying, "We come from Waterbury,
the land of eternal spring"; and there is a story of a Waterbury
owner in a sleeping-car, winding until his arm ached
and then passing it to a total stranger, saying, "Here, you
wind this for a while," with the result that the stranger
placed a large order for Waterbury watches to be sold by
his agency in China.</p>

<p>At the time that the Waterbury watch was well established,
the world had advanced to a point fairly approximating
the life of to-day. All the marvels of invention
which had lifted so much of the earth's manual labor from
the shoulders of mankind and which had been expected to
shorten working-hours and to cheapen products until the
standards of living of all classes would be raised through
the possession of beneficial products inexpensively produced—these
had gone far toward establishing the factory
system. Machinery had come into vogue in place of hand
labor. The steam-engine, the sewing-machine, the railway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>the steamboat, the cotton-gin, the threshing-machine
and the harvester, were indispensable aids. Photography
and typewriting were novelties no longer, and the phonograph
was becoming familiar. Electricity had taken its
place as one of man's most valuable servants, able to
transmit his messages, furnish him with power, and turn
his night into day. These are but a few of the countless improvements
that had contributed to the rapid rise of this
country as a manufacturing nation instead of one chiefly
agricultural.</p>

<p>Millions had already found employment in the factories,
the transportation systems, and other collective-labor
establishments. Schools had multiplied throughout the
country. Trains, for the most part, were run on schedule
time. Business offices, accompanying the development of
the great industrial concerns, employed thousands. The
department store was beginning to appear. Public-utility
organizations and government departments were growing
complex and extensive.</p>

<p>Thus, in every direction a stirring impetus was being
given toward those intricate modern conditions which depend
upon the watch. The lives of nearly all people were
beginning to be touched by affairs that demanded common
punctuality a number of times every day—the hour of
opening factory, school, office or store, the keeping of appointments,
the closing of banks and of mails, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>departure of trains. The times were bursting with need for
a closer watch on time. From the industrial president to
the common laborer and school-child the pressure of
modern life, with its demand for punctuality, was making
itself increasingly felt.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, watches were still regarded as
luxuries. It was not yet realized that they belonged among
the implements which the daily life required of all. The
notion still held that the watch was the mark of the aristocrat—a
piece of jewelry rather than an article of utility,
a thing more for display than for use. And the prices of
good watches, according to the standards of the day, were
such as to perpetuate the idea.</p>

<p>It is no wonder then that, in spite of its crude characteristics,
the low-priced Waterbury watch attained a considerable
sale. A watch was a novelty, an uncommon possession
among average people, and anything approximating
a real watch was assured of a large sale if within reach of
the ordinary purse. Therefore, the commercial failure of
the Waterbury Watch Company involves something more
than a mere business failure. Here is something which textbook
economists may well undertake to explain, since the
article was good, the need unsupplied, the competition
feeble, and the profit satisfactory. The Waterbury watch
enjoyed an initial success but, in spite of satisfactory quality,
its sale gradually fell away, until, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>several refinancings and changes of management, undeserved
failure ultimately overtook the first low-priced
watch-venture. It was not the manufacturing problems,
such as had overcome Howard and had sorely tried Dennison,
but the problems of distribution which were the
undoing of the Waterbury Company, and here the importance
and power of the middleman stand out in an
instructive way.</p>

<p>The conditions of the age demanded a cheap watch.
Things to come could not eventuate except through the
ability of everyone to measure his minutes. Almost from
its first announcement, the Waterbury sprang into demand,
but later succumbed to false policies of sales. Eagerness
for the large and easy orders, which were momentarily
attractive but finally fatal, spelled ruin.</p>

<p>When first put out, the watch was sold through stores at
a very moderate price and proved to be such a sensation
that it suggested itself to ingenious merchants as a trade-bringer
when offered as a premium with other goods.</p>

<p>Sam Lloyd, the famous puzzle-man, was among those
who saw this possibility and he devised a scheme which
resulted in the giving-away of hundreds of thousands of
Waterburys; it consisted of puzzles printed on cards. These
puzzles were so simple and yet so cleverly designed that
while anyone could solve them, each thought himself a
genius for his success in doing so. Lloyd's idea was to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>his puzzles to clothing stores all over the country and sell
them with watches, in order that those dealers might distribute
the puzzles all over town, together with an announcement
of a guessing-contest. Each successful contestant,
upon return of the puzzle with its solution, was
privileged to buy a suit of clothes and get a Waterbury
watch with it free of charge.</p>

<p>Such was the magic of a watch in those days that the
Waterbury boomed the business of hundreds of clothiers,
who, as in nearly all something-for-nothing schemes, were
careful to add more than the cost of the watch to the price
of the suit. Nevertheless the idea took so well that Lloyd
spread it into Europe, China, and other parts of the world.
Thus, the Waterbury watch became a familiar object in
many lands. Adaptations of the scheme, applied to other
wares, were carried out by him and by others until giveaway
propositions became the main channel of distribution
for these watches. For a time, such methods flourished and
the regular trade of ordinary watch-dealers correspondingly
languished. But, finally, the scheme-idea lost its
novelty and pulling power. People would not forever buy
clothes in order to get watches. In the process, the Waterbury
name had become a byword for tricks in all trades.
Shoddy clothes at all-wool prices had become associated
with it in people's minds. They stopped buying these
watches in ordinary stores because others "gave" them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>away. Regular dealers cut the prices to get rid of their
stocks, and this led to further demoralization because customers
never knew whether or not they were buying at the
bottom price. Dealers could make no money on them under
such market conditions and, because of this and of their
shady association with give-away deals, the Waterbury
name became a stench in the nostrils of the legitimate
trade.</p>

<p>Thus, when the scheme-trade died away and the company
again turned its attention to the watch-dealers whom
it had forgotten in the flush of its easy success, it found no
welcome. It had forsaken its source of steady customers
and was now forsaken in return. After floundering about in
several further reversals of trade policy and causing the
loss of further investment for its backers, the Waterbury
name was abandoned and the company reorganized as the
New England Watch Company. As such it ventured into
new fields of watch manufacture and offered an elaborate
variety of small and fancy watches and cases, and numerous
models, sizes, and styles of movements sold on vacillating
marketing policies. Never did it attain a genuinely
sound footing, however, for it vacated its field of fundamental
and distinctive usefulness, viz., the production of
a reliable, low-priced, simple watch, to meet the advancing
requirements of its day; it had gone back to the view-point
of the watch as an ostentatious or ornamental bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>vanity. Hence the old Waterbury business was compelled
to close its doors, and in the fall of 1914, the first year of
the Great War, was bought out at a receiver's sale by a
firm who had replaced it in the field of supplying watches
for the masses. This firm rededicated the organization to
its original mission, modernized its mechanical equipment,
and revived the Waterbury name after a lapse of twenty
years, until to-day, through the employment of judicious
sales-methods, the factory is more successful than ever it
was in its earlier days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN<br />

<small>"<i>The Watch That Made the Dollar
Famous</i>"</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> next development is so typically American
that it is difficult to picture it as occurring in any
other country.</p>

<p>Heretofore, the history of timepieces had been that of an
easily traceable evolution, for each of its steps had grown
naturally out of those before it, and the various improvements
had been made by mechanics trained in the craft.
Yet now, strange to relate, two young men from a Michigan
farm, with no mechanical training, entered the field
almost in a casual manner, and in less than a generation
not only became the world's largest manufacturers of
watches but effected the most radical development in the
whole story of telling time—involving, as it did, the introduction
of interchangeable parts, quantity-production,
and a low price.</p>

<p>These results might seem at first, to be due to a matter
of accidental good fortune. On the contrary, they were an
example of evolution quite as logical as any that had
preceded and were perhaps even more significant. The
whole development came as the direct product of observation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>analysis, initiative, perseverance, and hard work—the
element of good luck being conspicuously absent.</p>

<p>All history gives evidence of the occasional need of a new
impulse derived from outside, and bringing with it a fresh
view-point. There seems to be a tendency in human enterprise
for any development after a time to lose its original
rate of speed and to spend itself in complexities. The people
who have brought it about appear to lose their power
to see things simply and in a big way; and, on the contrary,
they grow technical and occupy themselves with minor details.
Whereupon the progress of development becomes
slower and slower, and threatens to stop entirely. Then
over and over again, there is the record of the advent of
some fresh new force from an unexpected direction which
restores youth and vigor.</p>

<p>In the last decade of the nineteenth century, watch-making
seemed ready for such an impulse. As we have already
seen, it had long been developing from within along
technical and professional lines. Excellent and costly timepieces
that were marvels of accurate mechanism had been
produced. That part of its work had been well done, but
the industry was in danger of losing its human touch.
Watches were being viewed more as articles of manufacture
and merchandise than as of wide-spread human service
in meeting a general public need.</p>

<p>In a sense, therefore, the industry was unconsciously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>waiting the coming of a non-technical man who knew the
public at first hand and understood people's requirements,
who was not fettered by tradition, who had a vision of
universal marketing and distribution, and who was not
held back by a fore-knowledge of difficulties. It was exactly
this vision which Robert H. Ingersoll had of the industry
and he developed it with the assistance first of his
brother, Charles H. and later of his nephew, William H.
He did not "discover" the dollar watch, as many think,
but grew toward it during the course of a dozen years.</p>

<p>It came about, as already stated, in a manner that was
typically American. Young Ingersoll left his father's farm
near Lansing, Michigan, in 1879, at the age of nineteen,
and went to New York to seek his fortune. He was entirely
without technical training save in farming, but he
had a considerable first-hand knowledge of the needs and
desires of what Lincoln called the "common people."
Finding employment for a time, he saved One Hundred
and Sixty Dollars, and, with this large capital, started in
business for himself in the manufacture and sale of rubber
stamps. Before long he was able to send back to Michigan
for his younger brother, Charles H. Being of an inventive
turn of mind, he devised a toy typewriter which attained
a considerable sale as a dollar article. This was followed by
a patented pencil, a dollar sewing-machine, a patent key-ring
and other novelties of his own creation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>In the course of time, the products of other manufacturers
were added to the list. Thus the brothers soon found
themselves with an embryo manufacturing and wholesale
jobbing business. The business grew, and the next development
was that of a mail-order department. In this branch
they were pioneers and preceded by some years the famous
mail-order houses of Chicago and elsewhere. Their catalog
ran into editions of millions of copies. Next, the Ingersolls
became pioneers in another sales-plan. They developed the
chain-stores idea, starting with a retail specialty store in
New York, and following it with six others. Incidentally,
they found themselves among the largest wholesale and
retail dealers in the country in bicycles and bicycle
supplies.</p>

<p>All of this was a strange but none the less effective
preparation for watch-making and the marketing of
watches by millions. Robert Ingersoll, who had remained
in the selling and promoting end of the business, knew
little about watches, but since he was constantly
engaged in traveling about the country and in talking with
merchants and others, he was gaining a great fund of
knowledge as to human needs and market possibilities.</p>

<p>Presently he became convinced that his business, in spite
of its prosperity, lacked something vital. He grew dissatisfied
with handling a succession of unimportant novelties.
It began to dawn upon his mind that these things were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>hardly worth while as a subject for a business, since they
satisfied only passing fancies on the part of the public. He
must find something which was really worth while, something
which filled a real human need on a large scale and
yet in a new way. If this something could be found, and
the incredibly large buying power of the great American
public could be focused upon it, there was hardly any limit
to the business which would result.</p>

<p>When this belief had crystallized in the form of a definite
conclusion, he began at once to search for the "big idea."
The "big idea" had long been waiting for him to reach this
state of mind. It had been looking him in the face for many
days had he but been ready to perceive it.</p>

<p>On the wall of his room in a Brooklyn boarding-house
there hung a very small "Bee" clock. It was unobtrusive
and apparently unimportant. He had glanced at it hundreds
of times with no thought beyond that of learning the
time. Suddenly, it ceased to be a clock and became an
open door into the future. Its ticking became articulate
with a new meaning.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Glimpse of a Giant Industry</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>This picture shows one corner of the huge plants which produce
twenty thousand Ingersoll watches a day.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Everyone wishes to tell time," it said. "There is not
one of the millions who crowd the cities, travel the highways,
or spread over the country districts, who does not
wish repeatedly during his waking-hours to know what
time it is. Sometimes he is in sight of a clock, but more
often he is not. Here and there is a man with a watch in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>pocket. That man has a chance to be efficient; but good
watches cost money, and most people cannot afford them.
Here am I, a tiny little ticking clock; I am a good timekeeper
and I am cheap. Make me a little smaller, sell me
for a dollar, and you can put the time into everyone's
pocket."</p>

<p>At this point, the non-technical man, who knew nothing
about watches, but who understood human needs, realized
that something had happened; he pondered deeply and
began to investigate. He took the little clock to a machinist
in Ann Street, New York, and together they studied the
possibility of reducing it in thickness and diameter. Presently
it was discovered that both the New Haven and the
Waterbury Clock Companies had already produced articles
that embodied these conditions. This somewhat
checked enthusiasm until it was recalled that neither of
these products was an especial factor in the time-telling
field. The manufacturers had merely made mechanisms;
they had not grasped the Big Idea of universal service.</p>

<p>The timepiece of the Waterbury Company was the
smaller, and Robert Ingersoll decided to test his mail-order
market, buying first, one thousand clock-watches at
eighty-five cents each, and afterward contracting for ten
thousand more. These articles were offered in the mail-order
catalog for 1892 at a dollar each, for the sake of
price-uniformity with the other dollar specialties upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>which the firm was concentrating. This was done, however,
in a small way. It was not desired to sell too many on such
an unprofitable margin, but merely to test the dollar-watch
idea, hoping that manufacturing charges might
ultimately be brought down through quantity production.</p>

<p>These so-called "watches" must not be confused with
the Waterbury watch; that, as already described, had been
the output of another company. The "watches" marketed
by the Ingersolls and bearing their name were in reality
thick, noisy, sturdy little pocket-clocks, wound from the
back. They were crude and clumsy affairs compared with
present-day styles but were, nevertheless, reliable timekeepers.</p>

<p>The public responded to the idea of dollar watches, although
these proved to sell faster in gilt cases than in
nickel, and still faster when a five-cent gilt chain was
added. The next year, came the World's Fair in Chicago
and the odd little mechanism with an appropriate design
stamped upon its cover attracted some attention from the
visitors.</p>

<p>Thus was born the Ingersoll watch, although it bore
slight resemblance to the watch of to-day. This is due to
the fact that an immediate policy of experiment and improvement
was inaugurated. During these changes, however,
several points remained fixed. One of these was that
the watch must be in no respect a plaything, but a practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>accurate timekeeper, not liable easily to get out of order.
The second was the definite association with the price of
one dollar, so that it became possible to refer to it humorously
as "the watch that made the dollar famous;" and the
third was that it should have a sturdy ruggedness of construction
that would defy ordinary hard usage.</p>

<p>Each of these points had its social value—that of the
last-named being the fact that the dollar price put the
possession of a real timepiece within the reach of multitudes
who were engaged in forms of activity wherein a
delicate timepiece would be apt to get out of order.</p>

<p>The Ingersolls soon became convinced that they had a
worthy object for promotion, and they did not entertain
the slightest doubt as to the existence of a waiting public.
There passed before their minds a picture of the millions of
farm-boys who did not know when it was time to come
into dinner, of the millions of working-men who had nothing
to guide them in reaching the factory on time, of millions
of clerks and school-children and of still other millions
comprising the bulk of American homes where more good
timepieces were needed.</p>

<p>Their problem, therefore, resolved itself into two main
divisions—those of manufacture and those of sale. The
manufacturing end involved a contract with the great plant
of the Waterbury Clock Company, by which this factory
was to produce the goods according to the specifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>and under the name, trade-mark, and patents of the Ingersolls.
This arrangement continues to this day, but has been
supplemented, as the line has become more extended, by
the acquirement of two factories of their own, one in
Waterbury, Connecticut, and one in Trenton, New Jersey.
To-day the three plants produce an aggregate of
about twenty thousand watches a day. Before such manufacturing
results could be obtained, however, there were
many structural problems to be solved. It was not so easy
as it sounds to build a practical and accurate watch within
the narrow limits of a dollar and still leave a profit for
both the manufacturer and dealer.</p>

<p>The solution began with the adoption of the "lantern-pinion,"
but the principal difficulty was that which had
baffled both Howard and Dennison—the problem of producing
the extremely minute separate watch-parts in large
quantities by machinery, and yet with such exquisite precision
that all parts of one kind should be absolutely interchangeable.
By dint of unwearied patience and much
scientific research, this problem was finally solved, and it
is said that Henry Ford got his idea of quantity-production
from the manufacture of the Ingersoll watch. Incidentally,
it was demonstrated that low production-costs carry with
them high wages. In the field of watchmaking, no element
was more necessary than the skill of well-paid workers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the public was waiting, but it did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>know that it was waiting. It was going about its business
quite unaware that mechanical and manufacturing problems
were being solved in its behalf. There were no eager
millions standing about demanding watches in order that
their lives might be run more closely upon an efficient
schedule. Therefore, simultaneously with the consideration
of mechanical and manufacturing problems came those of
sale, which will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN<br />

<small><i>Putting Fifty Million Watches
Into Service</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span> this were purely a story of the development of
timepieces as mechanisms, there would be little to add
to the preceding chapter, save to detail the refinements
and improvements by which a cheap, clumsy, but reliable
watch gradually discarded its defects, while retaining its
virtues, and the manner in which it developed into a variety
of styles and sizes. Essentially, however, this is a
story of <em>Man</em> and <em>Time</em>, of human needs as served by timepieces.
The most perfect piece of mechanism in a showcase
is like a stove without a fire; it is a mere possibility of
service, whose value does not begin until it is set to work.</p>

<p>We have arrived, then, at a time when a small percentage
of the total population carried accurate timepieces and
was able to profit by the more efficient adjustment of its
actions thus secured. We have seen how the promising
experiment of the Waterbury Watch Company failed in
an attempt to equip the masses with watches, principally
through defects in its system of distribution, and we have
noted the appearance of another low-priced watch dedicated
to a similar experiment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>It is obvious, therefore, that if the Ingersoll firm has already
been able to place fifty million separate watches in
the service of humanity, something unprecedented must
have taken place in the all-important field of distribution.
It is significant that Robert H. Ingersoll first called his
watch the "Universal;" indeed, his chief contribution to
the development of the watch is the idea of <em>universality</em>, a
word that makes us think more of people than of manufacturers'
methods. Having, then, a watch that was universal
in its possibilities as well as in name, and being
keenly aware, through his own tastes and experiences, of
the needs of the vast mass of the public, his greatest problem
became that of universal distribution; in short, it was
a selling-problem. At first, there could be no definitely
formulated plan; various methods must first be tried out.
From these experiences there gradually arose an adequate
system of reaching the millions of people who needed
watches.</p>

<p>In this, Mr. Ingersoll had effective cooperation. He was
the pioneer, the salesman, the promoter, the one who knew
men in the widest sense and had the faculty of getting results.
His brother, Charles H., was the internal administrator
and constant counselor. Later, there was added to
the firm a nephew, William H., who was both a student
and an analyst. He scrutinized trade-tendencies, deduced
theories from what he saw, and gave them wide application
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>in actual tests. Together the members of the firm
worked out sales-principles of equal opportunity and
equal treatment—words that had long constituted a
slogan in politics but were something of a novelty as
applied to business. In other words, they based their
plans upon the <em>consumer</em> rather than upon the <em>factory</em>,
and upon the idea of goods sold <em>through</em> the trade rather
than <em>to</em> the trade. It took some time, however, to perfect
their system of distribution but, when finally developed,
it was the outgrowth of wide and varied experience.</p>

<p>The firm made its first sales-efforts on the watch through
its own mail-order catalog. The results brought some encouragement,
but proved that in itself this method could
never bring the volume of sales necessary for a high-geared,
uniform quantity of production.</p>

<p>The next recourse was to the so-called "regular trade-channels"—the
jobbers and retailers. But these dealers
displayed little interest. They were not promoters of new
lines, but distributors of those for which a market already
existed. The jobber sold what the retailers required; the
retailers what the public demanded. Robert Ingersoll's
original loud-ticking watch impressed them more in the
light of a curiosity than as a trade-possibility. In particular
it failed to appeal to the jewelers, since they felt it to be
out of keeping with the beauty and value which characterized
their stocks of jewelry and silverware. They reasoned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>also, that sales of the new timepiece would interfere
with those of their higher-priced watches, thus failing
to grasp the fact, since proved to be true, that its use
would greatly enlarge the sphere of their sales through
cultivating a general watch-carrying habit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Here is represented the final stage in the development of modern
timepieces. Though of graceful lines, they are designed for
accuracy and utility, and are ranged in price to fit every purse.</i></p></div>

<p>Some effort was made with outside trades, but these
generally considered watches to be out of their line. Nevertheless,
in the course of time, persistent effort began to
bring results. Occasionally jobbers made purchases, and
here and there a jeweler or hardware dealer offered the
watches for sale. When the firm felt justified in spending
some money for advertising, the public began to learn at
first hand of the Ingersoll watch, and the sales gradually
increased. Many people, however, expressed doubt as to
the quality of a timepiece that could be sold for a dollar,
and the Ingersolls replied with a guarantee that has since
become famous.</p>

<p>Then, in the natural course of business, competition developed
from the marketing of inferior goods, and the firm
found it necessary to place its name on the dial for purposes
of identification. In spite of all difficulties, there
grew up in course of time a very considerable public demand.
Whereupon certain dealers undertook privately to
raise the price in order to increase their profits. This situation
was met by emphasizing the price more prominently
on the boxes and in the advertising, a policy which soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>put an end to price-raising but led, in some instances, to
the even greater difficulty of price-cutting. The better
known became the price, the greater became the temptation
to dealers of a certain class to advertise its reduction
in order to bolster up "bargains" upon other goods. This
naturally demoralized the sales of neighboring dealers and
caused them to lose interest in the line. Thus, instead of
increasing the sales, the reduced price proved a serious
selling obstacle.</p>

<p>The same difficulty has been encountered by other
manufacturers of widely advertised goods, and some of
them have sought through the courts to compel adherence
to their prices, the argument being, as in the case of the Ingersoll
watch, that price-cutting does not serve the interests
of the public but tends to interfere with sales since it
obstructs the channels of distribution. At this writing, the
question in its legal phase has not yet reached a final
decision in the courts, but the Ingersolls have solved it in
a practical way, since their trade-policies have brought
about the voluntary cooperation of the retailers.</p>

<p>Such cooperation, however, was not to be attained at
once. It came about through much study and after much
experience. It involved the assembling of a large amount of
data upon commercial economics and a deep inquiry into
the fundamental principles of retail distribution. It proved
necessary to weigh and compare recent and important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>factors in the retail situation. For example, because of the
fact that so many manufacturers were giving indiscriminate
discounts for quantity purchases, it had become
profitable to establish huge department stores, chain-stores,
and mail-order houses whose scale of operation
made it possible to handle goods in large amounts.</p>

<p>For a time, the Ingersolls, in common with other manufacturers,
gave discounts for purchases in quantity; later,
as the business grew and its distribution problems were
more scientifically studied, they saw more clearly the way
in which the principles of equal opportunity and equal
treatment could be applied.</p>

<p>It was in this spirit that the firm began to ask itself
whether the large distributors were really more efficient
than the small retailers; whether they actually earned the
extra amount which they were paid for selling each watch,
and whether it would be a healthful thing for the country
if all retail business were transacted through such organizations—in
short, whether restrictions to such a system
were really consistent with the theory of commercial
democracy.</p>

<p>Approached from this standpoint, the answer was found
to be in the negative. A careful research among stores in
all sections of the country showed unmistakably that the
cost of selling in a small store was actually less than in the
department store, the chain-store, or the mail-order house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Viewing the sale of each watch as an individual transaction,
it was seen that a small store in some far-off country
village gave quite as valuable service as did a large store in
a metropolis, and therefore should be paid as much. Consequently,
the Ingersolls introduced a selling-plan which,
under the conditions, was as revolutionary in the field of
retail distribution as the discovery of Galileo had been
in that of clock mechanism. Yet it was merely that of a
flat-price schedule; in other words, it was a provision that
the dealer buying one dozen watches, or even one single
watch, should pay exactly the same price as the dealer who
bought ten thousand. Quantity discounts were definitely
abandoned.</p>

<p>Naturally, this plan met with cordial response from the
countless small retailers scattered throughout the length
and breadth of the country, and the close relationship thus
established led to other logical developments in the way
of cooperation, such as that of display devices suited to the
needs of these dealers, a simplified accounting system to
increase their efficiency, and various measures of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a constantly increasing advertising
appeal resulted in a rapidly growing demand from the
public, and this, in turn, made possible the assuring a uniform
quantity of output, which was in itself the basis
necessary for maintaining uniform quality. Thus practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>experience and scientific trade-study were formulated into
what has come to be recognized as a definite commercial
philosophy, namely, that of uniform quality, uniform
quantity, uniform demand, uniform price to the dealers
and uniform price to the consumer—a statement of principles
in which, as in the works of a watch, each part must
be geared to every other to insure effective operation.</p>

<p>During the time that these business principles were being
formulated, the line of watches was also in process of
development with the goal of universality in view. Thus, it
was presently realized that while the dollar watch was
essentially a man's timepiece, watches were also needed by
women and by children. Accordingly, smaller models were
developed to meet these needs. At a later date, the Ingersoll
business principles were extended into the field of
jeweled watches, when the factories of the Trenton Watch
Company and the New England Watch Company were
acquired. At the date of the present writing, there are
more than a dozen models, each of which is adapted to a
different need and use, but the manufacture of no model is
undertaken unless there is a market for at least a thousand
watches a day.</p>

<p>And the latest development as this is written is the time-in-the-dark
watch.</p>

<p>Do you recall a soldier in the "foreword" waiting in the
darkness for the perilous moment to go "over the top" with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>his eyes fixed upon the luminous hands and figures of the
watch strapped to his wrist? This watch may now be
named; it was the "Radiolite." How it came into existence
in time to go into the Great War is a story in itself.</p>

<p>This story is the latest step in that steady progress of
democratization by which accurate timetelling, once a
privilege of the few, became the possession of the many.</p>

<p>A good many people wish to tell time in the darkness as
well as in the light, and if these people could afford to, they
bought expensive repeaters. Such watches, however, cost
hundreds of dollars, so that while telling time in the light
had come within the reach of everyone, telling time in the
darkness was still possible for very few. Therefore, the
watch could not yet be held to be of equal service to all
humanity in every one of the twenty-four hours. This
equal service at any moment was finally made possible in
a somewhat extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>In the year 1896, Monsieur and Madame Curie startled
the world with the discovery of radium. They found that
certain substances emitted rays that would pass through
solid matter as light passes through glass or as the wind
blows through a screen. They were finally able to secure
tiny quantities of a whitish powder, salt of radium, which
gave forth an energy that acted upon everything brought
near to it and this energy they calculated, would be protected
uninterruptedly for three thousand years. Up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>present time, radium and radioactivity are subjects of
constant study and research, but radium exists in such
small quantities and is so enormously costly that comparatively
few have had a chance to experiment with it.</p>

<p>It seems a little strange to think of using the most precious
substance in the world—many times more costly
than diamonds—in order to bring time-telling-in-the-dark
within the reach of every person, but this is exactly what
has been done.</p>

<p>People had long been experimenting with paint made
from phosphorous in order to give off a glow in the darkness
which would be sufficient for time reading, but phosphorus
has its limitations; it must first be exposed to
light before it is taken into the darkness, and if a watch-dial
treated with phosphorus is buried in the pocket it
cannot absorb enough light in the daytime to be luminous
at night. With radium, however, the problem was solved.
It was found that this amazing substance would affect
certain other substances, causing them to shine for years
in the darkness by means of their own light.</p>

<p>Thus it became possible to develop a luminous coating
which the Ingersolls applied to the hands and figures of
their "Radiolite" watch and, presto! the problem of telling
time in complete darkness was mastered to the advantage
of every buyer. The inexpensive watch revealing the hour
with equal visibility in inky darkness as in bright daylight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>had become a reality. In passing, it is interesting to note
that the experiments with the watch-face led to many
other developments, such as luminous compasses, gun-sights,
airplane guides, and the like.</p>

<p>Then came the World War, and the wrist-watch which
had been often ridiculed as effeminate (although it is hard
to explain why, since it was first adopted as an obvious
convenience in the Army and on the hunting-field—two of
the most masculine spheres of activity it would be possible
to imagine) was seen at once to be the most easy means of
knowing the time in actual warfare. Millions of watches,
consequently, were strapped to wrists of soldiers and sailors,
and the obvious advantages of the luminous dial
placed it in enormous demand. Thus it came about that
the scene described in the opening pages was typical of
countless instances upon various fronts.</p>

<p>Although a matter of surprisingly few years, considered
chronologically, there is a long distance, measured by the
scale of progress, between the moment when a young man,
glancing casually at the clock on his bedroom wall read
wonderful possibilities in its face, and the time when the
firm he founded was able to take note of such achievements
as these:</p>

</div>

<p>Factory facilities producing an average of twenty
thousand accurate watches a day; distribution facilities
including the cooperation of a <em>voluntary</em> "chain-store system"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>of more than one hundred thousand independent
retailers, all operating upon a common plan and under
common prices; a product that has come into the most
wide-spread use not only throughout the United States but
in the farthest regions of the inhabited earth—which has,
in fact, in itself served to turn back the tide by which
watches formerly flowed from Europe into America, so that
it now proceeds from our shores toward those of Europe
and other lands; a name which has become as well known
as any in commercial and industrial life, and better than
all, the appreciable raising of the efficiency of the human
race through universally promoting the watch-carrying
habit and putting fifty million timepieces into service. It
is altogether an Aladdin tale of modern business.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN<br />

<small><i>The End of the Journey</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever, at the end of a journey—perhaps
across water, or up to the top of some high hill—look
backward to the place from whence you
came, and wonder that it seemed so far away?</p>

<p>Now as we have completed our journey together through
the history of man's struggle to gain knowledge and control
over time, we are impressed with the great contrast
between Time as it was to mankind in the beginning, and
Time as it is to us to-day.</p>

<p>The caveman, with whom we began this story, lived
close to nature, taking his sense of time from her as he took
all else. Morning was when the light came, and he waked
and was hungry; noon was when the sun was highest, and
night was the time of lengthened shadows and the state of
darkness. We see these same things, but, for us, they have
not the same meanings. We count the time by hours and
minutes, and we reckon these by machines which we have
made, called clocks and watches. These mean so much
more to us that, when we set all the clocks forward another
hour to save daylight, it seemed to us as if we had
changed the actual time. It was practically as if we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>performed the miracle of Joshua, who in Bible story, made
the sun stand still, or the miracle of Isaiah, who made
the shadow go back ten steps on the dial of Ahaz. After a
few days, we did not feel as if we had set the clocks; we
felt as if we had made the sun wait for us, and the very
day come earlier.</p>

<p>And so it is with the seasons. The caveman called it
spring when the swallows came, and autumn when the
leaves changed their color. But we judge of these things by
the calendar; we say that the spring "is very late this
year," or that the "leaves are beginning to turn early."
We have a proverb that one swallow does not make a summer;
no, nor do all the swallows, so far as we moderns are
concerned. It is summer for us upon a certain day, no
matter what the swallows do, but for the caveman, summer
was when the swallows came, whenever that might be.</p>

<p>It is like that to-day among primitive peoples. The Turk
who listens for the crowing of a cock or the braying of an
ass to tell him of the hour, or calls the cat to him to look at
its eyes and judge the time by the shape of their pupils—he
is more like the caveman in this than like ourselves. So
is the South Sea Islander, who knows the season of the
year from the direction of the trade-winds. So is the patient
savage, who cares little as to how long he must
wait for the creature he is hunting to come near the spot
where he lies hidden.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>How different it all is with ourselves! We rise at a certain
hour, and so many minutes later we have our breakfast.
At such a time, we must be at work. Our work itself is all
made of appointments one after another, or of tasks to be
finished within a certain time. Our meals, our hours of rest,
our meetings with our friends, our recreations, and our
pleasures—all these, until, again, at a certain time we go
to bed, in order that so many hours of sleep may make us
fit for the next day, are measured by the clock and counted
out by the tick of a toothed wheel or the regular swing of
a pendulum.</p>

<p>We say that the savage has no sense of the value of time.
We have, and it is by that fact largely that we are better off
than he. Value means measure; you cannot value a thing
unless you can measure it exactly. And so because we can
measure time, we can see what time is worth to us, and
make it worth more. The savage keeps an appointment—when
he happens to make one. But we, because we know
how long it takes to reach a certain place, or how long a
time we need or wish to spend with a certain man, can
make and keep many appointments. We can travel like the
wind from place to place, because in measuring time we can
measure speed, and therefore we can make speed safe and
possible. We can talk to a friend a thousand miles away, or
signal by electric waves around the world. We do these
things because our sense of time has told us that the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>way of sending letters and messages was too slow. And so
we have set to work to invent ways that should be quicker.
We should never have had the telephone, the cable, or
the wireless, unless we had cared about time and been able
to measure it.</p>

<p>The caveman lived, perhaps, as many years as we—but
how much did he do in those years? We, who have learned
to measure years and to allot each day or hour to sundry
tasks, have made ourselves able to do far more in a life-time—many
times more. We do not live a greater number
of years, but it is as if we lived many lives in one. We
speak of time as we speak of money, of saving and wasting
and spending. Well, Time is Money, as Ben Franklin
said, but it is something more—Time is Life. And we think
of our lives as so much time at our command, and therefore
we can make the most of them. The gulf between us
and the primitive men is a contrast of living less or more,
and our <em>more life</em> comes in great measure from our having
learned to <em>measure time</em>.</p>

<p>Everyone has read the story of Aladdin and his wonderful
lamp. You will remember that the poor boy came into
possession of a lamp which quickly made him the richest
and most powerful person in the world, since, through
owning it, he could control the service of a mighty <i>genie</i>,
able to perform the most incredible tasks.</p>

<p>The modern man—every man—is something like Aladdin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>only he is much more powerful. He has the <i>genie</i> of
steam to work for him when he pulls the lever, and the
<i>genie</i> of electricity ready to serve him if he but press a
button. He has many other mighty servants that modern
science has given to him, but greatest of all, most useful of
all, is the <em>Slave of the Watch</em> which lies in his pocket—mighty
Time himself.</p>

<p>This ability to record time and therefore, to control it, is
perhaps the greatest of all man's triumphs. Only see what
it has done for him! Have you ever thought of yourself as a
person of no special importance?—why, you have far more
actual power than was possessed by Alexander the Great,
Julius Caesar, or Charlemagne!</p>

<p>You can command forces and can accomplish results
that would have made any of these proud autocrats stare
in wonder. If you do not stand out above your age, as they
did above their ages, it is simply because millions of other
people besides yourself also possess these powers. It is
undoubtedly true that we are to-day a race of giants, and
it is also true that each of our powers is directly or indirectly
due to the common fact that we all can keep track
of time. For consider that what mankind can accomplish
to-day depends upon the ability of people to work together,
and that working together would cease if people
had no accurate means for telling time.</p>

<p>For example, you make a railway journey upon a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>of importance to you. The first thing that you do is to
examine a time-table on which is shown the minute when
the train is due to leave. You calculate to yourself how
many minutes you must allow for reaching the station,
and then look at your watch to see how long you will still
have for other work. If you had not watch or clock, or you
were dependent merely upon the position of the sun, you
might go to the station several hours ahead of time in
order to be "on the safe side." During the hours thus saved
you can accomplish a great deal of work. It is as though
your day had been made several hours longer.</p>

<p>Unseen in your pocket, your watch ticks steadily. You
trust it absolutely, and you know that it will be faithful
to its trust. Occasionally you glance at it and, when the
hand reached the limit of safety, you start for the train.
You reach the station three or four minutes before train-time
and find the tracks clear; no train is in sight.</p>

<p>This however, does not cause you the least uneasiness.
You merely take your watch from your pocket and look
expectantly up the line. Perhaps a minute before the train
is due, you hear a distant whistle, then the approaching
roar of wheels upon the rails, and, just as the watch-hand
reaches the proper moment, the train itself whirls round
the curve and draws up to the station, exactly on time.</p>

<p>As you proceed upon your way, you notice how other
people at other stations are also meeting their schedules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>and conserving their time. You see the conductor glance at
his watch as he gives the engineer the starting-signal. You
realize that the whole transportation system is merely an
enormous piece of clockwork and that it, in turn, is a part
of the vaster clockwork of modern civilization.</p>

<p>Turn where you will, there is nothing that you can do
and nothing that you can use which is not dependent upon
the ticking of clockwork. The locomotive which pulls your
train, the cars in which you ride, the rails over which you
pass, all of these are products of factories, but the factories
are run upon the time-basis; there is no other way in which
they could be run.</p>

<p>The workmen in these factories leave their records upon
time-clocks when they come and when they go. If the
workmen were not there at the same time, the work could
not be done, since most of modern work depends upon the
ability of people to work together at the same task. Even
if one man were late, it might lose time for many. The
clothes that you wear come from other factories where
other workmen have time-clocks and watches. The buildings
that you see from the windows were put up on the
time-basis and were paid for according to the movement
of the hands upon watch dials.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time Pieces Vital to Industry</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Without the ability to record time, and, therefore, to control it,
the complex web of human activity would become hopelessly
tangled.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>You buy a newspaper, making sure that you are getting
the latest edition, and it is at once as though you looked
into a great mirror reflecting the activities of all the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>but all of the dispatches bear a date-line, and many of
them are also marked with the hour.</p>

<p>Before the days of newspapers, people felt themselves to
be a part of the lives of their own immediate neighborhood
and knew only vaguely of what went on at a distance, but
now each day one feels himself to be a part of the great
human family and can sometimes make his plans with
reference to things that may be occurring thousands of
miles away. But the newspaper itself is a product of clockwork;
there is perhaps no institution whose workers keep
closer track of the passage of the minutes.</p>

<p>In view of all these things, does it seem too much to
claim that if all the timepieces in existence were destroyed
and men were given no other means for telling time, civilization
would swiftly drop to pieces and man would find
himself traveling backward to the conditions of the caveman?</p>

<p>But there is one thing in our modern timekeeping which
we still have in common with the first men who ever kept
the time. We still go by the sun and the stars and refer all
our measure to that apparent revolution of the heavens
which we know to be really the motion of our world itself.
As did those wise men of old Babylon, so do we even now,
spying upon the mighty master clock of the universe to
correct all our little timepieces thereby. A man sits alone
in an observatory, with his eye to a telescope. That telescope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>is of a certain kind, called a "transit." It is fixed upon
the meridian, the north-and-south line in the sky over that
place. And a thread of spider-web across the lens marks for
him the exact position of the line, in the very middle of his
field of view. So as he watches, he can see one star after
another come into view at one side of the glass and pass
across it to the other side and disappear. He is watching
the world go round.</p>

<p>A certain star appears, one which his calculations have
told him will cross the meridian at a certain particular
instant. Beside him is an electrical device connected with
a clock, which marks off seconds at intervals round a revolving
drum. The star draws nearer to the center of his
field. As it crosses the hair-line, the observer touches a key,
and the precise instant of its crossing is recorded upon the
drum, to within a fraction of a second. Since the clock has
marked its record of the seconds there, the clock can be
corrected by the star.</p>

<p>Now, if that man had been a priest in Babylon, he
would have kept his knowledge as a means of power to
himself and to his equals. If he had been a dweller in a
somewhat later age, he would have kept it to himself no
less, either because people would not believe, or because
the claim of too deep knowledge of the secrets of nature
might put his life in danger. But he is a modern, and so
his knowledge is for all who seek it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>On some tall building in a distant city, a time-ball hangs
suspended at the top of its pole, and people pause to look
up at it. They hold their watches in their hands. Upon the
tick of noon, an impulse will come from the observatory,
and the ball will drop. Then those who have been looking
will set the hands of their watches and pass on. At the same
instant, the news of noon will be flashed by telegraph
across the land, and by wireless to ships at sea. The whole
Western Union system will suspend business for a little,
while the lines are connected and the observatory at
Washington ticks off the seconds. Everywhere there are
electric clocks, automatically controlled by some master
clock, which, in its turn is governed by the observatory
time. So we all, as a matter of course and without thinking,
set our watches by the star. Civilization every day catches
step with the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Back of all that we see of life, therefore, stands the great
fact of measuring time, and those who are engaged in giving
to man the instruments for this purpose have a special
responsibility. Perhaps the ancient peoples were not so
far wrong when they permitted time-telling to be a privilege
of the priests. It is far more than a matter of moneymaking;
it is a fixing for humanity of the standards of
daily life; it is a duty which lies at the foundation of modern
efficiency; it is even a sacred trust.</p>

<p>Therefore, the man who makes or sells unreliable timepieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>is false to his trust. Through his action people are
thrown out of adjustment with the world about them, and
they, in turn may seriously interfere with the plans of
many others. It is hard to believe that there are some
people who still look upon a watch as "jewelry," or that
there are some dealers who are more interested in the
watch-case than in the movement it contains.</p>

<p>The watchman of olden times was a public officer. He
was chosen for his reliability, and people felt confidence
when he called the hours. The watch-dealer of to-day is in
a somewhat similar position; he has a serious duty to his
community. He is not chosen by the public, and yet, even
more than the watchman, he is a public servant since the
watches that he puts into people's pockets are their principal
means of adjustment to the busy affairs of life. In a
sense, he supplies them with the basis of their efficiency.
His duty is that of supplying the largest practicable degree
of accuracy to the largest possible number of people.
The <em>Slave of the Watch</em> will not obey the owner of an inaccurate
timepiece.</p>

<p>Time itself is elemental; it had no beginning, it can have
no ending. It is like a great ocean which flows round all of
the earth, and neither begins nor ends in any one place.
But time for any man is exactly according to his use of it.
It is as though a man were to go to the shore of the boundless
ocean, with a tin cup in his hand. If he could get no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>more than a cupful of water, it would not be because of
any limit in the amount available, but merely in his means
for carrying it away. Should he have a pail, a barrel, or any
larger receptacle, then the water would belong to him in a
correspondingly larger amount.</p>

<p>Thus, time each day presents itself equally to everyone
upon the earth, but some receive it in cups, some in pails,
and some in barrels. Some make of their day a thing of
no results, while others fill it with real achievement.
Those who achieve are they who have learned to value
time, and to make it serve them as the mighty <i>genie</i> that
it is.</p>

<p>These are the wonders which Kipling had in mind when
he wrote:</p>

<h2>APPENDIX A<br />

<small><i>How It Works</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> traced out the history of the clock and watch mechanism
all the way from De Vick's first clock and the clumsy old
Nuremberg Egg down to the perfect time-keeping device
which we have today, it may be interesting to look a little more closely
at the result of so many years and so many inventions—to see what
its parts are, and how they are put together, and to observe how the
wonderful little machine does its work.</p>

<p>Modern clocks and watches are nearly enough alike in their structure
and way of working, so that if we understand the one, we shall
easily understand the other also. The differences between them are few
and slight and easy to explain. So let us take for our example a typical
modern watch movement, which is easily the more beautiful and
interesting mechanism of the two.</p>

<p>First of all, as we saw in the days of De Vick and Henlein, a watch,
or a clock, is a <em>machine for keeping time</em>. So it must have three essential
parts: first, the power to make it go; second, the regulator to make
it keep time; and third, the hands and face to show plainly the time
it keeps. Each of these three parts is itself made up of several others.</p>

<p>The power or energy which runs the watch is put in to it by the
winding which coils up the mainspring. The outer end of this spring
is attached to the rim of the main wheel (1) and after the spring is
wound this wheel would whirl round and let the spring run down instantly
if there was nothing to stop it. The teeth on this wheel, however,
are geared into the second or center pinion (as shown in illustration
at "A") which makes it run the entire movement while running
down slowly instead of flying round and uncoiling at once.</p>

<p>As we will see later, the spring-power is transmitted through the
train of wheels and the lever (7) to the balance wheel (8) which lets the
escape wheel (5) turn a little each time it swings, while it simultaneously
receives, by means of the lever from the escape wheel, the "impulse"
or power which keeps it running. Thus the swinging of the
balance lets the mainspring down gradually while drawing its power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>from it. The spring is made as thin as it can be and still have power
enough to make the watch go. For a modern watch, this is about one
flea-power. One horse power, which is only a small fraction of the
power of the average automobile, would be enough to drive all the
millions of watches in the world.</p>

<p>The center pinion into which the mainspring is geared is attached
to its staff to which is also fastened the large center-wheel (2) so that
the spring cannot turn this pinion without also turning the center
wheel. But the center wheel is, itself, geared into the third pinion,
which is attached to the third wheel (3), and this again is geared into
the fourth pinion attached to the fourth wheel (4). The fourth wheel
gears into the escape pinion which revolves with the escape wheel (5),
so that none of these wheels or pinions can turn except when the
escape wheel does. But there is a constant pressure from the spring
on all of these wheels, which together constitute what is called the
train.</p>

<p>The escape wheel, therefore, wants to turn continually and if it was
not restrained it would revolve rapidly, letting the movement run
down. But it is retarded and can only turn from one tooth to the next,
each time the balance (8) turns. This action is secured by connecting
the balance and the escape-wheel by means of the lever (7), one end
of which forms an anchor shaped like a rocking-beam, called the
pallet (6). In the pallet are two jewelled projections called the pallet-jewels
which intercept the escape-wheel by being thrust between its
teeth, letting it turn a distance of only one tooth at each swing of the
balance as the pallet rocks back and forth.</p>

<p>The other end of the lever is fork-shaped, having two prongs. On
the staff with the balance instead of a pinion as all the other wheels
have, is a plain, toothless disc called the roller, from the lower side
of which projects a pin or rod made of garnet. This is called the
jewel-pin or the roller-jewel. The roller being fastened to the balance-staff,
of course, turns just as the balance turns and with it the
jewel-pin. And the lever is just long enough and is so placed that every
time the balance turns, the jewel-pin fits into the slot between the
prongs of the lever-fork carrying it first one way, and then, as the
balance comes back, the other way. Thus the lever is kept oscillating
back and forth, rocking the pallet and withdrawing one pallet-jewel,
releasing the escape-wheel just long enough to let it run to its next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>tooth before the other pallet-jewel is thrust in to stop it. It is a
beautiful thing, to watch, like the beating of a tiny heart, or the
breathing of a small quick creature. The hairspring (9) almost seems
to be alive. And indeed, it is in a way, the very pulse of the machine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_232"></a>
<img src="images/i_232.jpg" width="400" height="362" alt="A Modern Watch Movement" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>A Modern Watch Movement</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is only one more important point to understand. You know
how the power gets as far as the escape wheel from the mainspring,
and how the motion of the balance lets the escape-wheel revolve a
tooth at a time, but you have still to learn how the power which keeps
the balance rotating reaches it from the escape-wheel through the
lever. Here is the most interesting feature of a watch movement.</p>

<p>After the balance has been started, its momentum at each turn
starts the lever when the jewel-pin strikes it, but unless the balance
was constantly supplied with new power it would soon stop, and the
watch would not run. It will be noticed, however, from the illustration,
that the teeth of the escape-wheel are peculiar in shape and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>different from those of the other wheels. The ends of the pallet-jewels
are also cut at a peculiar angle.</p>

<p>Now, each time just before the jewel-pin starts to shift the lever
from one side to the other, the latter is in such a position that one of
the pallet-jewels is thrust in so that its side is against that of one of
the teeth of the escape-wheel, keeping it from turning. But the instant
the lever commences to move it begins to draw this pallet-jewel
outward from the tooth until the corner of the jewel passes the corner
of the tooth. Then the escape-wheel is released and the power that
is behind it makes it turn quickly, and on account of the shape of the
tooth, it gives the pallet-jewel a sharp push outward, swinging the
lever, causing it at the other end to impart a quick thrust to the jewel-pin,
thereby accelerating the speed of the balance and renewing its
momentum.</p>

<p>Thus the balance receives the power to keep it in motion, swinging
it as far as the hairspring allows. The hairspring then reverses it and
swings it until the jewel-pin again starts the lever in the other direction,
releasing the escape-wheel from which it receives another "impulse"
and so on as long as the mainspring is kept wound. A watch
in perfect time ticks five times to the second. That means 18,000
swings of the balance every hour, or 432,000 in a day. And in that
time, the rim of the balance travels about ten miles.</p>

<p>A clock is essentially only a larger and stronger watch, just as a
watch is a clock made small enough and light enough to be carried
about conveniently. But the working of the two is practically the
same. They are but different members of the same family, varying
types of one time-keeping machine which is among the most ingenious
and valuable things that man has made.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to know about a watch is that if it is keeping
good time, it will serve for a fairly accurate compass. So if you are
ever lost in the woods, your watch may help you out again. Lay it flat
face upward, and point the hour hand toward the sun. Then South
will be in the direction half way between the hour hand and the figure
12, counting forward as the hands turn in the morning hours, and
backward in the afternoon. This is because the hour hand moves
around the dial just twice as fast as the sun moves around the sky,
making a full circle in twelve hours while the sun makes its half
circle from horizon to horizon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>Now, the sun is always to the southward of you as you are anywhere
north of the equator. At noon, the sun is practically due South.
At that hour, both hands of your watch are together on the figure 12
and the hour hand pointing at the sun points in that direction. At
6 a.m. the sun is nearly East, so if the hour hand, now on the figure 6
is pointed eastward toward the sun, then South would be in a line
just over the figure 9. At 6 p.m., the sun being in the west and the
hour hand pointed at it, South would be half-way back toward the
figure 12, or just over the figure 3. For other morning or afternoon
hours, the same reasoning holds true.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX C<br />

<small><i>American Watch Manufacturers</i><br />

(CHRONOLOGY)</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Judged</span> by the number of failures which have marked the development
of the American watch industry, watch manufacturing
might well be characterized as a perilous business. While it has
proved profitable for a few, it also has swallowed many fortunes.</p>

<p>There were no watch companies in America until 1850, although a
few attempts were made to manufacture watches in the United States
prior to that time—by Luther Goddard, who established the first
American watch factory at Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, in 1809 and
made several hundred watches from 1809 to 1815, when he finally
abandoned the business; by Henry and James F. Pitkin at East Hartford,
Connecticut, from 1838 to about 1845 and by Jacob D. Custer
at Norristown, Pennsylvania, from 1840 to 1845.</p>

<p>Except for a few companies whose organization and speedy dissolution
had small, if any, effect upon the industry as a whole, the following
briefly outlines the history of American watch manufacturing
companies from the real beginning in 1850 to the present day:</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1850</i></p>

<p>The American Horologe Company of Roxbury, Massachusetts,
organized; name changed same year to The Warren Manufacturing
Company; in 1853 name was again changed to The Boston Watch
Company, the principal stockholders of which organized The Waltham
Improvement Company to buy land and buildings for The Boston
Watch Company at Waltham, Massachusetts; moved into the new
factory at Waltham in 1854; failed in 1857 and company's business
was bought in by Royal E. Robbins, watch importer of New York
City and Tracy &amp; Baker, watch case manufacturers of Philadelphia;
in 1858 The Waltham Improvement Company increased its capital
and purchased the business and property of The Boston Watch Company
and re-incorporated under the name of The American Watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>Company; in 1885 the name was changed to The American Waltham
Watch Company and in 1906 the name was again changed to The
Waltham Watch Company, its present name; in 1913 the Company
purchased the business of the Waltham Clock Company.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1857</i></p>

<p>E. Howard &amp; Company of Roxbury, Massachusetts, was organized
by Edward Howard; in 1861 the name was changed to The Howard
Clock &amp; Watch Company; in 1863 the company practically failed and
was reorganized under the name of The E. Howard Watch &amp; Clock
Company; in 1881 the Company again practically failed and was
again reorganized under the name of The E. Howard Watch &amp; Clock
Company, with Edward Howard as President, as he had been in the
preceding organizations; in 1882 Howard withdrew as President and
severed his connection with the Company. From that time forward
the Company gave increasingly greater attention to the manufacture
of clocks, although it continued to manufacture the Howard watch
until about 1903 when it entered into a contract with The Keystone
Watch Case Company of Philadelphia, under which The E. Howard
Watch &amp; Clock Company transferred to The Keystone Company all
rights to the use of the name "E. Howard" in connection with the
manufacture of watches and also changed its own corporate name to
The E. Howard Clock Company. Later the company failed and was
operated by receivers until 1910 when a new company of the same
name was organized and purchased the property of the old concern.
The Keystone Company purchased the factory of The United States
Watch Company at Waltham, Massachusetts, and began the manufacture
of watches under the name of The Howard Watch Company.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1859</i></p>

<p>The Nashua Watch Company of Nashua, New Hampshire, was organized;
it failed in 1862 and was bought in by the American Watch
Company—now The Waltham Watch Company.</p>

<p>The United States Watch Company of Marion, New Jersey, was
organized; it failed in 1872 and was operated by creditors for a short
time under the name of The Marion Watch Company, but again
failed; machinery of the company was sold to E. F. Bowman of Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, who manufactured a few watches and then sold
the business to The J. P. Stevens Watch Company of Atlanta,
Georgia.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1864</i></p>

<p>The National Watch Company was organized and erected a factory
at Elgin, Illinois; in 1874 the name was changed to its present name
of The Elgin National Watch Company.</p>

<p>The Tremont Watch Company of Boston was organized, with
Aaron L. Dennison, one of the founders of the original Waltham
Watch Company as superintendent; it ceased business in 1868 because
of lack of capital; machinery of the company was sold to an English
syndicate which organized in England The Anglo-American Watch
Company, the name of which was later changed to The English
Watch Company.</p>

<p>The New York Watch Company of Springfield, Massachusetts, was
organized by Don J. Mozart and others; it practically failed in 1866
and was reorganized under the same name; again failed in 1870 and
the business was taken over by a new company known as The New
York Watch Manufacturing Company. This Company survived
only a few months and the property and business were taken over by
a new group in January 1877 under the name of The Hampden Watch
Company, which company, in turn, was later purchased by John C.
Deuber and associates in control of The Deuber Watch Case Manufacturing
Company of Canton, Ohio, which was originally organized
at Cincinnati about 1888.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1867</i></p>

by Don J. Mozart after leaving The New York Watch Company;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>was reorganized under the same name; in 1879 it was again reorganized
and the name was changed to The Springfield Illinois Watch
Company, which was later changed to The Illinois Watch Company,
under which name it now operates.</p>

since which time the remaining stock has been marketed by The
Illinois Watch Case Company of Elgin, Illinois.</p>

<p>The Adams &amp; Perry Watch Manufacturing Company of Lancaster,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>Oppenheimer Bros. &amp; Vieth, selling agents of New York City, began

<p><abbr title="Robert">Robt.</abbr> H. Ingersoll &amp; <abbr title="Brothers">Bro.</abbr>, of New York City, first introduced the
original Ingersoll watch to the public at the World's Columbian
Exposition; in 1892 the Ingersolls had contracted with the Waterbury
Clock Company of Waterbury, Connecticut for the manufacture of
the low-priced watch, which was first sold for $1.50 and later for $1.00;
in 1908 the Ingersolls purchased the factory and business of the Trenton
Watch Company of Trenton, New Jersey, and began watch manufacturing
on their own account; in 1914 they purchased the plant of
The New England Watch Company, formerly The Waterbury Watch
Company of Waterbury, Connecticut.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1894</i></p>

<p>The Webb C. Ball Company of Cleveland, Ohio, founded in
1879 and incorporated in 1891, began the manufacture of watches.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1899</i></p>

<p>The Keystone Watch Case Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
was organized. It controls The Howard Watch Company of
Waltham, Massachusetts, The New York Standard Watch Company
of Jersey City, New Jersey, The Crescent Watch Case Company,
Inc., of Newark, New Jersey, and The Philadelphia Watch Case
Company of Riverside, New Jersey.</p>


<p class="center big"><i>1902</i></p>

<p>The South Bend Watch Company of South Bend, Indiana, was
incorporated in New Jersey under the name of The American National

<small><i>Encyclopedic Dictionary</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Abrasion</span>—Wearing away by rubbing
or friction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adams, J. C.</span>—A promoter instrumental
in organizing the Elgin, Illinois, Cornell,
and Peoria Watch Companies, and the
Adams &amp; Perry Manufacturing Company.
He invented and patented the "Adams
System" of time records in use on most of
the railroads in the West. He last appeared
in prominent connection with the watch
and clock business as the organizer of the
Swiss horological exhibit at the World's
Columbian Exposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Addenda</span>—Tips of the teeth of a wheel
beyond the pitch circle. Sometimes of
circular outline; sometimes ogive—that
is, of a shape patterned after the pointed
arch. The addendum is also known as the
"face" of the tooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adjustment</span>—The manipulation of the
balance with its spring and staff to secure
the most accurate time-keeping possible.
Three adjustments are usually made,
viz.: for isochronism, temperature and
position. Much of the difference in value
and cost of watches depends on this
operation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adjustment to Isochronism</span>—Strictly
speaking this would cover all
adjustment; but it is technically understood
to mean an adjustment of the balance
spring so that the time of vibration
through the long and short arcs of the
balance is the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adjustment to Positions</span>—The manipulation
of the balance and its spring so
that a watch keeps time in different positions.
Good watches are usually adjusted
to five positions. They are pendant up;
<abbr title="3">III</abbr> up; <abbr title="9">IX</abbr> up; dial up; and dial down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adjustment to Temperature or
Compensation</span>—The adjustment of the
balance and spring so that the time-keeping
qualities are affected as little as possible
by changes in temperature. See
<i><a href="#Compensation">Compensation</a></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ahaz</span>—King of Judea, 742-727 B. C.
See <i><a href="#Dial_of_Ahaz">Dial of Ahaz</a></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alarm</span>—Sometimes spelled "alarum."
A mechanism attached to a clock whereby
at any desired time a bell is struck rapidly
by a hammer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aluminum-Bronze</span>—An alloy of aluminum
and pure copper, usually in the
proportion of 10 parts of the former and
90 of the latter. It is considerably lighter
than brass and highly resistant to wear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anaximander</span>—Greek astronomer to
whom the Greeks ascribed the invention
of the sun-dial in the sixth century B. C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arbor</span>—The axle or axis on which a
wheel of a watch or clock turns. Also
applied to a spindle used by watchmakers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arc</span>—Any section of the circumference
of a circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archimedes</span>—A famous Greek philosopher
and scientist sometimes credited
with the invention of the clock. About
200 B. C. he made a machine with wheel
work and a maintaining power but having
no regulator it was no better as a time
teller than a planetarium turned by a
handle. It may have furnished the suggestion
for later time-keeping machines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arnold, John</span>—Born 1736. An English
watchmaker of note. He invented the
helical form of the balance spring and a
form of chronometer escapement much
like Earnshaw's. Died 1799. Arnold's
devices have been most useful and permanent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assembling</span>—The putting together of
the finished parts of a watch. In a three-quarter
plate watch this is done on the
lower plate. In a full plate movement it is
easier and more satisfactory to assemble
on the top plate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Astrolabe</span>—1. An instrument of various
forms formerly used especially in
navigation to measure the altitudes of
planets and stars. 2. A projection of a
sphere upon any of its great circles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Astronomical Time</span>—Means solar
time, as computed from observing the
passage of the sun across the meridian
from noon of one day to noon of the following
day. It is counted continuously up
to 24—not in two 12-hour divisions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Astronomy</span>—The science which treats
of the motions, real and apparent, of the
heavenly bodies. Upon this science,
through its determination of the length
of the year, is founded the science of
horology—or time-keeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Automata—for Striking</span>—Very common
on old clocks and very complicated,
such as: Indian King hunting with elephants,
Adam and Eve, Christ's flagellation,
and many others. See <i><a href="#Clocks_Interesting_Old">Clocks,
Interesting Old</a></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Automatic Machinery</span>—The second
great contribution of America to watchmaking
after the establishment of the
principle of interchangeability of parts,
and making possible the effective execution
of that principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Auxiliary"></a>Auxiliary</span>—A device attached to a
compensation balance to reduce what is
known as the "middle temperature error."
Some are constructed to act in high
temperatures only—as Molyneux's; and
some in low temperatures only—as
Poole's.</p>


<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">Balance</span>—The vibrating wheel in a
watch or chronometer which with the
aid of the balance spring (hair-spring)
regulates the rate of travel of the hands.
The balance is kept in vibration by means
of the escape wheel. See <i><a href="#Compensation_Balance">Compensation
Balance</a></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balance Arc</span>—In detached escapements,
that part of the vibration of the
balance in which it is connected with the
train. The remainder is called the drop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balance-Clock</span>—A form of clock
built before the pendulum came into use.
The regulating medium was a balance on
the top of the clock made with a verge
escapement. See <i><a href="#Foliot">Foliot</a></i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 188px;"><a id="i_254"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">BALANCE COCK</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Balance_Cock"></a>Balance Cock</span>—The
standard which supports the
top pivot of the balance.
In old watches often elaborately
pierced and engraved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balance Spring</span>—In
America usually called the
"hair-spring." A long
slender spring that governs the time of
vibration of the balance. One end of the
balance spring is fastened to a collet
fitted friction-tight on the balance staff,
the other to a stud attached to the balance
cock or to the watch plate. The most
ordinary form is the volute, or flat spiral.
The other form used is an overcoil. See
<i>Br&eacute;quet Spring</i>. The principle of the
isochronism of a balance spring was discovered
by Hooke, and first applied to a
watch by Tompion. The name hair-spring
comes from the fact that the first ones are
said to have been made from hog bristles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balance Spring Buckle or "Guard"</span>—A
small stud with a projecting tongue
attached to the index arm and bridging
the curb pins so as to prevent their engaging
two of the balance spring coils.
Used chiefly in Swiss watches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balance Staff</span>—The axis of the balance.
The part of a watch most likely to
be injured by a fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balance Wheel</span>—A term often incorrectly
applied to the balance itself,

<p><span class="smcap">Br&eacute;quet Spring</span>—A form
of balance spring which is
a volute with its outer end
bent up above the plane
of the body of the spring
and carried in a long curve
towards the center near
which it is fixed. Like all other springs in
which the outer coil returns towards the

isochronism by varying the character of
the curves described by the outer coil and
thus altering its resistance. So-called from
its inventor, Abraham Louis Br&eacute;quet (q.

that the overcoil allows expansion and
contraction in all directions, thereby
avoiding a good deal of side friction on
the pivots as well as insuring more nearly

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Calendar"></a>Calendar</span>—A system of dividing the
year into months and days. The principal
calendars known to history are: the Julian
calendar; the Gregorian calendar; the
Hebrew calendar; the Mohammedan
calendar; and the Republican calendar.
None of them has been quite accurate in
dividing up the solar year, and frequent
arbitrary corrections are necessary to
secure a practical approximation. See descriptive
article under each title.</p>

<p><i>Julian</i>—Established by Julius Caesar,
46 B. C., to remedy existing defects in the
Roman calendar then in use. The Julian
year was based on the assumption that the
solar year is 365&frac14; days—which was 11
minutes and 14 seconds too long. The
scheme adopted was to make the regular
calendar year 365 days, and to add one
day every fourth year. The Julian calendar
is still in use by Russia and Greece,
where the dates now differ from those of
most other countries by 13 days.</p>

<p><i><a id="Gregorian"></a>Gregorian</i>—Established October 15,
1582, by Pope Gregory <abbr title="the thirteenth">XIII</abbr>, in correction
of the obvious errors of the Julian calendar.
It is the calendar now in use by
nearly all civilized nations. The mean
length of the Gregorian year is 365 days,
5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds—26
seconds longer than the actual solar year.
Correction is made by adding a 29th
day for February every fourth year, excepting
when the date of said fourth year
is divisible by 100. If, however, the date is
also divisible by 400, the extra day is
added.</p>

<p><i>Republican</i>—The calendar of the
French Revolution (1793) declared to begin
at midnight on the meridian of the
Paris Observatory preceding the true
autumnal equinox, September 22, 1792.
There were 12 months of 30 days each
and 5 or 6 "extra days" (as might be
necessary) at the end of the year to bring
the new year nearest to the then position
of the equinox. Abolished January 1, 1806.</p>

<p><i>Hebrew</i>—Composed of 12 lunar months,
a thirteenth month being added from
time to time to secure correspondence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>the months with the passing seasons. The
months are arbitrarily arranged to have
alternately 29 days and 30 days. The
length of the calendar year varies from
353 days to 385 days.</p>

<p><i>Mohammedan</i>—Based on a lunar year of
354 days divided into 12 lunar months
which are alternately 29 and 30 days in
length. During each period of 30 years a
total of 11 days are added one at a time
at the end of a year. The lack of co-ordination
with the solar year results in a
total separation of the seasonal year and
the calendar year. In use in Turkey and
some other Mohammedan countries.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clepsydra</span>—A device
for the measurement of
time by the flow of running
water. Its simplest
form is a vessel filled
with water which trickles
or drops slowly from a
small aperture into another
vessel. One or the
other of the vessels is
graduated and the height
of the water in that
one at any given time
indicates the hour. Sometimes
a figure floating on
the water points to the hours. Later, falling,
or running, water was made to turn
wheels or to move a drum, as in "Vailly's
clock." Clepsydras were made and improved
up to the 17th century. The earliest
known example—one in China—is credited
with having existed in 4000 B.
C. The name indicates the stealing
away of water and is derived from two
Greek words meaning "water" and "to
steal." A common form of clepsydra in
India was a copper bowl with a small hole
in the bottom floating on water. When the
bowl filled and sank the attendant emptied
it, struck the hour upon it and floated
it again on the surface of the water. Like
the sun-dial, the clepsydra was invented
so long ago that there is no authentic
record of its origin. Its evident advantages
are exactly those which the sun-dial
lacked. It is quite independent of day or
night or other external conditions; it is
conveniently made portable; and by regulating
the size of the aperture through
which the water flows, it can be made to
work slow or fast so as, within considerable
limits, to measure accurately and
legibly long or short intervals of time.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of the clepsydra
were, first, that the hole in the container
tended to become worn away so as to let
the water out too fast; and second, that
the water ran faster from a full vessel
than from one nearly empty, because of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>the greater pressure. This latter was in
classic times corrected by a clepsydra consisting
of two vessels. The second and
larger of these was placed below, the
water running <em>into</em> it, out of the first. A
float within this larger vessel rose regularly
as it filled, and carried a pointer
which marked the time. The first vessel
from which the water ran into the second,
was provided with an overflow, and kept
constantly full up to this level; so that the
flow of water into the larger vessel remained
constant.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 288px;"><a id="i_259"></a>
<img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="288" height="515" alt="CLEPSYDRA2" />
</div>

<p>Once well established and understood
in principle, the clepsydra became widely
known over the ancient world, and underwent
a variety of improvements and modifications
in form. These latter chiefly dealt
with making it more legible. Means were
devised, for instance, to make it ring a
bell when the water reached a certain
height. And thus the alarm principle was
very early brought into use. Later on,
after the development of mechanical
devices like the pulley and the toothed
wheel or gear, the pointer was by these
means constructed to move faster or
slower than the rate at which the water
rose, or to revolve upon a
circular dial on which the
hours were marked. And
thus we owe to the clepsydra
the origin of the modern
clockface as well as of
the alarm. Later still, by a
more complex ingenuity,
devices were arranged to
strike the hours or to move
mechanical figures, in fact,
to perform all the functions
of a clockwork which
was both driven and regulated by hydraulic
power. The single hour hand, however,
remained in place of our two or three
hands moving at different speeds, as in
the modern clock or watch. The clockwork
also remained primitive in construction
compared with our own. Clepsydrae
were always expensive, because
accurate mechanical work was never
cheapened until modern time. Rather
they were made marvels of patient ingenuity
and lavish ornament. Cunning
oriental craftsmen spent their skill upon
elaborate mechanism and costly decorations.
The clepsydra thus became first
what other time-pieces later became—a
triumph of the jeweler's craft—a gift
for kings. And the Greeks, who beautified
everything that they touched, made it
at once more accurate and more artistic.</p>

<p>The clepsydra may thus fairly claim to
have been the first <em>mechanical</em> device for
measuring time, as contrasted with the
sun-dial which was really an astronomical
instrument; and thus the direct ancestor
of the mechanical clocks of later days.
Some authorities, indeed, on the strength
of certain very ancient allusions to its use
in China and elsewhere, claim for it an
antiquity prior to the sun-dial itself.
There seems, however, to be no reason for
supposing that the discovery of a mechanical
law like the regular flow of water
antedated so obvious a discovery as the
motion of a shadow upon the ground.
The explanation is probably that the
invention of the clepsydra did precede the
scientific perfecting of the sun-dial by the
inclinations of the gnomon; which may
have taken place about the time of the
correction of the Babylonian calendar in
747 B. C. Not long after this date we meet
with frequent references to the placing of
a clepsydra in the public square of some
old city, or to its use in astronomical
calculations. To this, of course, its property
of running by night was peculiarly
adapted.</p>

<p>Although the chief defects of the clepsydra
were minimized by the use of the
two vessels and by making the aperture
through which the water ran of gold or
some other substance which would wear
away very slowly, yet there remained
certain minor imperfections. The water
could not be kept entirely from evaporating;
it had to be emptied out at intervals
and the reservoir refilled; its accuracy
was affected by the expansion of the
parts under change of temperature, or
it might even freeze. These faults were
obviated in the sand-glass or hour-glass
which for short intervals of time was also

<p><span class="smcap">Clerkenwell</span>—A district on the
north side of the city of London within
the metropolitan borough of Finsbury. It
is distinguished as one of the great centers
of the watchmaking and jewelers' industries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>in England and long established
there. The Northampton Polytechnic
Institute, Northampton Square, has a

branches of the trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Click</span>—The click, pawl, or dog, is a
necessary accessory of a ratchet wheel. It
is a finger, one end of which fits into the
teeth of the ratchet, while the other is
pivoted on its tangent. The ratchet is
thus prevented from turning backward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock</span>—Specifically, a time-piece not
made to be carried about but to stand
upon a shelf or table, hang upon a wall
or as built into a tower. Formerly the
term signified particularly a time-piece
which struck the hours. The word has
its origin in the word for <em>bell</em> in Latin,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gloccio</i>; Teutonic, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">glocke</i>;
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cloche</i>; and Saxon,
<i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">clugga</i>. At one time the term
was used to denote timekeepers
driven by weights as distinguished
from those driven
by springs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock-Watch</span>—A watch

<p><span class="smcap">Clock, Bird-Cage</span>—An
old form of English
clock whose manufacture

run thirty hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock, Bracket</span>—A
form of clock very
popular in England during the reign of
Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, made to stand on a bracket

sides. These clocks had either a handle
on top or one on each side. They were
very beautifully finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock, Candle</span>—Wax or tallow candle,
usually twelve inches long and marked
with circular lines one inch apart. The
candle would burn one inch every twenty
minutes or three inches an hour. Invention
credited to King Alfred the Great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock, Grandfather's or
Long-Case</span>—A tall clock with an
anchor escapement popular thru-out
the later 18th and early
19th centuries in England and
America. Its excellent timekeeping
qualities are due to the very
long and heavy pendulum which
allows a small arc of vibration.
Not often made at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock, Lamp</span>—A long glass
tube upright on a metal stand
similar in shape to the old Roman
lamps. Figures were
painted on the tube to indicate
the hours—"12" in the middle
section, with "11" above and
"1" below the "12." The lamp
was filled with oil up to the
hour at which it was lighted—then
as the oil burned away
the time was indicated. This
form of clock was used at night
in Dutch and German rural homes until
a comparatively recent date.</p>

hands to the wind and snow, of the clock
to dust and dirt, and of the oil to freezing
temperature, turret clocks to keep time
must be fitted with some device to obtain
a constant force on the pendulum. The
first used was the remontoire but since
the invention of the gravity escapement
for the Westminster clock by Sir Edmund
Beckett this has been used instead.</p>

Old</span>: <i>Anne Boleyn's</i>—A
clock said to have
been presented to Anne
Boleyn by Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>
on their wedding morning.
It is about four
inches square and ten
inches high, of silver
gilt "richly chased, engraved,
and ornamented."
The weights are of
lead covered with copper,
gilt and engraved.
On one are Henry's and
Anne's initials, and true
lovers' knots. On the
other simply H. A. At the top of each
weight is "Dieu et mon droit," at the
bottom "The most happye." On the top
of the clock is the figure of a lion holding
the arms of England, the same being engraved
on the sides. The clock is now
silent. There is no record as to its maker.</p>

<p><i>Canterbury</i>—This was the third of
the large clocks in England. It was constructed
in 1292.</p>

<p><i><a id="Charlemagnes"></a>Charlemagne's</i>—In 807 the King of
Persia sent Charlemagne a bronze water
clock inlaid with gold. The dial consisted
of twelve small doors representing the
hours. Each door opened at the hour it
represented and the correct number of
balls fell out upon a brass bell. At twelve
o'clock twelve horsemen appeared and
shut the doors.</p>

Henry de Vick set up a
clock in the tower of
the palace for Charles
<abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr>. It was regulated by
a balance. The teeth of
the crown wheel acted
upon two small levers
called pallets which
projected from and
formed part of an upright
spindle or staff on
which was fixed the
balance. The clock was
regulated by shifting the weights placed
at each end of the balance. On the bell of
this clock the signal for the massacre

honor. The skull is of silver gilt and is
engraved with figures of Death, Time,
Adam and Eve, and the Crucifixion. The
lower part of the skull is pierced to emit
the sound when it strikes, being cut in the
form of emblems of the Crucifixion. The
works occupy the brain's position in the
skull fitting into a silver bell which fills the
entire hollow of the skull. The hours are
struck on this bell by a small hammer on a
separate train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pope Sixtus'</span>—Built by Habrecht of

the property of William <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>, King of
the Netherlands. In 1850 it was exhibited
in England after which it became the

<p><i>Rouen</i>—In the Rue de la Grosse Horloge
in Rouen a clock made by Jehan de
Fealius in 1389 is built in a tower which
surmounts an arched gateway. Its dial is
about six feet square. It shows the hours,
days of the week, and phases of the moon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>It still keeps excellent time and is the chief
clock of the city.</p>

<p><i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan's</i>—Erected
in 1671 above
the gateway of the old
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan's Church.
The clock had two
dials, back to back upheld
by a quaint
bracket. In a little
open belfry above were
the gaily painted figures
of Gog and Magog
which struck the quarters
on bells suspended near them. In 1830
the clock was sold to the Marquis of
Hertford who set it up at his home in
Regent Park.</p>

<p><i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's</i>—A clock existed prior to
1298 in the tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Cathedral
which struck the hours by means of mechanical
figures called Paul's Jacks. Later
a fine dial was added.</p>

<p><i>Strasburg</i>—Rebuilt twice after the
first one which was begun about 1352.
This first clock consisted of a calendar
which showed the principal movable
feasts. It showed also the movements of
the sun and moon. On the upper part was
a statue of the Virgin before which at
noon the figures of the three Magi bowed.
At the same time a cock automaton
opened its beak, flapped its wings and
crowed. 2. The second Strasburg clock was
erected about 1570. This was a very elaborate
mechanism, showing besides the
time, a calendar for a century, the movements
of the sun and moon, eclipses of the
same and other things. The striking was
done by an elaborate automatic arrangement.
(See Old Clocks and Watches &amp;
Their Makers—F. J. Britten.) 3. In 1842
the clock was again thoroughly reconstructed.
This, too, is a very elaborate
system of motions showing the movements
of sun, moon, and planets, also
sidereal time, a calendar, etc. The hours
and quarters are struck by automatic
figures.</p>

<p><i>Ulm</i>—In the eastern end of the old
Rathaus at Ulm is installed an astronomical
clock which dates from the beginning
of the 16th century. It was thoroughly repaired
in 1549 by the builder of the Strasburg
clock—Isak Habrecht. Shows in
addition to the hours, the diurnal and annual
revolutions of the earth and the
movements and phases of the moon. The
clock is an artistic achievement as well as
a mechanical wonder.</p>

<p><i><a id="Vaillys"></a>Vailly's</i>—A scientific water clock. It
consisted of a tin cylinder divided into
several small cells and suspended by a
thread fixed to its axis, in a frame on
which the hour distances fixed by trial
were marked. It was so made that the
water passed slowly from one cell to the
next and as it did so it changed the center
of gravity of the cylinder and set it in
motion so as to indicate the time on the
frame. Made about 1690.</p>

<p><i>Wallingford's</i>—Built in 1326 in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Alban's Monastery. It showed besides
the hours, the apparent motion of the sun,
the ebb and flow of tides, changes of moon,
etc. It continued to run until the time of
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>. Held by some to have been a
mere planetarium.</p>

<p><i>Wells Cathedral</i>—Clock built by
Peter Lightfoot, A. D. 1340 at Glastonbury
and removed to Wells Cathedral
during the Reformation, after the dissolution
of the Glastonbury monastery. In
1835 it was again removed to the South
Kensington museum. At that time the
worn-out works were replaced by a new
train, but the dial and knights were retained.
The dial is divided into twenty-four
hours and shows the motion of the sun
and moon. On its summit are eight armed
knights tilting at one another, lance at
rest by a double rotary motion.</p>

<p><i>Westminster</i>—A clock said to have
been erected at Westminster with the proceeds
of a fine imposed upon one of the
Chief Justices about 1288. About 1365
Edward <abbr title="the third">III</abbr> had a stone clock tower
erected at Westminster. This tower contained
a clock which struck the hours on
a great bell. It also contained other bells.
This tower was razed by the Roundhead
mob about 1650. Later a dial with the
motto "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Discite justiam monite</span>" was
placed on the site. The bell "Great Tom"
was given to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's about the beginning
of the 18th Century. The present
Westminster clock is made after plans by
E. B. Denison (Sir Edmund Beckett) and
made by E. J. Dent. The bell is called
"Big Ben." It is claimed to be the best
timekeeper of its kind in the world. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>for use in this clock that Denison invented
his gravity escapement.</p>

<p><i>Wimborne</i>—A very old clock at Wimborne
in Dorsetshire, much like the Wells
Cathedral clock. By some authorities believed
also to have been planned by Peter
Lightfoot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock-Setters</span>—During the early history
of turret clocks, for each one was
employed a caretaker called the "setter."
That such an official was needed indicates
that they were more or less undependable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cock</span>—A horizontal bracket. See: <i><a href="#Balance_Cock">Balance

<p><span class="smcap">Collet</span>—A collar or flange on a cylindrical
piece of metal. Any part of such
cylinder of greater diameter than the rest.
Sometimes of the same piece of metal;
sometimes fitted friction tight upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Compensation"></a>Compensation</span>—The provision made in
a clock or watch to counteract the expansion
and contraction due to variations
of temperature. In the clock it is applied
to the pendulum; in the watch to the
balance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;"><a id="i_264a"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Compensation_Balance"></a>Compensation Balance</span>—A
balance corrected for errors
caused by variations in temperature.
The type in most
general use was invented by
Thomas Earnshaw in the second half
of the 18th century. The double rim of
this balance is constructed of brass and
steel soldered together in the form of a
cut ring, the brass on the outside. When
heat, elongating the balance ring, causes
it to vibrate more slowly, the brass, expanding
more than the steel, bends the
free ends of the cut rim toward the center,
thus decreasing the diameter of the balance
and quickening the vibration. On
the other hand, when cold, contracting the
ring tends to quicken the vibration of the
balance, the contraction of the brass rim
draws the free end outward, making the
diameter larger and the vibration slower
in consequence. The compensation balance
is also made with brass as the inner
metal and aluminum outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Compensation Curb</span>—A laminated
bar of brass and steel or aluminum and
brass fixed at one end, the free end carrying
the curb pins that regulate the length
of the balance spring. Common in old
watches but not now in use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Compensation Pendulum</span>—A pendulum
so constructed that the distance
between the point of suspension and the
center of oscillation remains constant in
all temperatures. See: <i><a href="#Pendulum_Gridiron">Pendulum, Gridiron</a>

<p><span class="smcap">Cusin, Charles</span>—A watchmaker from
Autun, Burgundy, who laid the foundation
for the Swiss watch industry in
Geneva in 1587. It grew very slowly at
first—in 1687 having only one hundred
watchmakers with three hundred assistants.
In 1760 there were at Geneva
eight hundred watchmakers with 5,000 to
6,000 assistants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Custer, Jacob D.</span>—(1809-1879.) A
Pennsylvania clockmaker in 1831; he was
one of the early makers of watches in
America in 1840. However, his work was
not important commercially, for he produced
only about a dozen watches. A very
ingenious man, who, it is said, made everything
from a steam engine to his own shoes.
He made hundreds of the clock movements
which at that period were used to revolve
the lanterns in lighthouses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cycle of the Sun</span>—A period of
twenty-eight years, after which the days
of the week again fall on the same days of
the month as during the first year of the
former cycle. It has no relation to the
sun's course but was invented for the
purpose of finding out the days of the
month on which the Sundays fall during
each year of the cycle. Cycles of the sun
date from nine years before the Christian
era.</p>

was apprenticed to a watchmaker. Later
in working at the trade, he was impressed
with the inaccuracies which existed in the
best handmade watches. This, with a visit
to the Springfield Armory, gave him his
idea of machine-made watches with interchangeable

year over the period of 12 lunar months,
amounting to about 11 days. The new
moons will thus fall about 11 days earlier
in each succeeding year. In a calendar so
arranged 30 days are taken off every
fourth year, as an intercalary month, the

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Anchor</span>—The
recoil escapement, invented
by Hooke, used in
most house clocks. A name
also applied to one kind of
Lever Escapement with an
unusually wide impulse pin.
The recoil escapement is one in which each
tooth of the escape wheel, after it comes
to rest, is moved backward by the pallets.
Altho one of the easiest escapements to
set out correctly the pallets are often improperly
formed making an escapement
which gives indifferent service. As a timekeeper
the anchor escapement is inferior
to the dead-beat escapement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement,
Chronometer</span>—A
detached escapement
in which the
escape wheel is
locked on a stone
carried in a detent, and in which the teeth
of the escape wheel impart an impulse to
a pallet on the balance staff with every
alternate vibration. Used in Marine
Chronometers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Crown-Wheel</span>—Of the
recoil type, and the earliest known escapement;
to be found in Henry de
Wyck's clock. Not suitable for watches.
Practically the same principle as Verge
or Vertical Escapement used in watches
for so many years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Escapement_Cylinder"></a>Escapement, Cylinder or
Horizontal</span>—Invented by
Thomas Tompion in 1695—later
improved and brought
into general use by Graham. It
dispensed with the then common
vertical crown-wheel—hence the
term "horizontal" and permitted thinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>watches. This escapement is frictional,
the balance being carried on a
hollow cylinder whose bore is
large enough to admit the
teeth of the escape wheel. The
cylinder is cut away where the
teeth enter and the impulse is
given by the wedge shaped teeth striking
against the edge of the cylinder as they
enter and leave. Used at this time in the
cheaper Swiss watches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Dead-Beat</span>—Any
escapement in which
the pallet face is so formed
that the escape wheel remains
dead or motionless
during the supplementary
arc of the balance or swing of the pendulum.
As invented by George Graham,
the wheel is much the same as the wheel
in the anchor escapement, the difference
lying in the shape of the pallets. Each
pallet has a driving face and a sliding
face. It is so arranged that the impulse is
given the pendulum at the midpoint of its
swing thus allowing the swing to adapt
itself to the impulse and keep the time
constant. The pallets are faced with
jewels so that there is slight friction.
Used in high grade clocks such as regulators
and astronomical clocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Detached</span>—Any escapement
in which the balance or pendulum
is for some time during each vibration
free from the pressure of the train. Detached
escapements are used in chronometers,
most watches and in turret
clocks. They are of value in any movement
where the motive power varies
greatly—hence in turret clocks. Examples:
Chronometer, lever, and gravity
escapements.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, <a id="Double_Three-Legged_Gravity"></a>Double
Three-Legged Gravity</span>—Invented
in 1854 by E. B. Denison, Esq.,
for the great clock at
the Houses of Parliament. It is
the best escapement for very
large clocks where the hands are
exposed to the action of the
wind and snow, because it admits
of great driving power in
the movement without its
sensibly affecting the escapement as
would be the case in the dead-beat type.
The impulse to the pendulum is given by
the weight of the lever arms falling
through a given distance and is therefore
constant. This escapement consists of
two gravity impulse pallets pivoted in a
line with the bending point of the pendulum.
There is a locking wheel made of
two thin plates of three teeth each. Between
these plates are the three pins that
lift the pallets. The locking is effected by
blocks screwed to the front of one pallet
and the back of the other. Impulse is
given by the pallets in turn striking the
pendulum rod. The pendulum rod serves
to unlock the wheel. The arrangement is
such that the lifting pins have a little
free run each time. Since the pallets are
always lifted the same distance they give
a constant impulse to the pendulum.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Duplex</span>—Invented
by Hook; later improved
by Tyrer. Very accurate
but as originally made
was affected by any sudden
motion, and hence of little use in watches.
The escape wheel has two sets of teeth.
Those farthest from the center lock the
wheel by pressing on a hollow ruby cylinder
fitted round the balance staff and
notched so as to permit the passing of the
teeth as the balance moves in a direction
opposite to the wheel's motion. The second
set stand up from the face of the
wheel and one gives impulse to the pallet
every time a tooth leaves the notch. This
is not a detached escapement, but there is
little friction. As improved this escapement
was used in the famous Waterbury
watches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, <a id="Four-Legged_Gravity"></a>Four-Legged
Gravity</span>—Invented by E. B.
Denison (Sir Edmund Beckett).
The same in principle as the
Double Three-Legged escapement,
only it has but one
escape wheel with four teeth or
legs instead of two wheels with
three legs each. The wheel has
two sets of lifting pins—one
acting on each pallet. Occasionally
used in regulators and other clocks
with a seconds pendulum, but of doubtful,
if any, advantage over the Graham
dead-beat escapement.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement
Lever</span>—Invented
by Thomas Mudge
about 1765. It is
the preferred escapement for
watches because of
the certainty of its performance. Possibly
inferior to the chronometer escapement as
a timekeeper. Its most noticeable defect
is the necessity of applying oil to the
pallets, the thickening of which affects the
action. There are many other kinds of
lever escapements. The Mudge escapement
was essentially like the modern
Double Roller. The connection between
the balance and the escape wheel is made
by a lever to which the pallets are fastened,
and into the forked end of which
plays the ruby pin which is carried on a
roller on the same staff as the balance.
Each pallet has an impulse face and a
locking face. The impulse is given by the
escape wheel tooth striking the impulse
face of a pallet and is communicated to
the balance by the lever, raised by the
pallet's movement striking the ruby pin
in the roller. This ruby pin also serves to
unlock the pallets by causing the lever to
lift them in turn. This escapement is of
the detached type. The action of the
lever is kept within the desired limits by
banking pins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Lever—Club Tooth</span>—An
escapement like the Table Roller in
the action of the lever and roller, but differs
in the pallet action. The impulse
planes are partly on the teeth and partly
on the pallet. This is the standard watch
escapement of today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Crank Lever</span>—An escapement
with a small roller having a
tooth like a pinion leaf projecting from its
circumference. This tooth acts in a square
notch cut in the end of the lever. The
lever is formed like a fork the two points
of which act as safety pins against the edge
of the roller to prevent the lever from getting
out of action with the roller. It necessitated
very careful construction and was
not so good as the Double Roller or Table
Roller.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Lever—Double
Roller</span>—This escapement
has two rollers on the balance
staff, the large one carrying the
balance staff and the small one
used for a safety roller only. The
best form of lever escapement but more
delicate, expensive, and difficult to make
than the Table Roller; hence not so much
used as the latter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Patent Detached Lever</span>—Introduced
in 1766 by Thomas
Mudge, but neglected for years thereafter
even by Mudge himself. It was in some of
its parts the model of the best form of
lever escapement—the Double Roller.
The first pallets had no "draw" on the
locking faces which rendered the escapement
peculiarly sensitive to jolt and jar.

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Lever—Pin-Pallet</span>—A
lever escapement with round pins for
pallets, and the inclines on the escape
teeth. Used in alarm clocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Rack-Lever</span>—Invented
by Abbe Hautefeuille in 1734. Afterward
made and improved by Berthoud and by
Peter Litherland, who obtained a patent
for it in 1794. It consisted of anchor
shaped pallets on whose axis was fixed
a rack, or segment of a toothed wheel
which geared into a pinion on the axis of
the balance. The balance was thus never
free from the train and good timekeeping
was made impossible. It is not now in use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Lever-Resilient</span>—Invented
by F. J.
Cole about 1870. A form of
lever escapement designed to
obviate the evils of overbanking. The
points of the escape-wheel teeth are bent
toward the locking faces of the pallets, the
bend in the tooth acts as the banking and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>no pins are required. It was abandoned
because expensive to make and the danger
of overbanking is not considerable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Lever—Table Roller</span>—Excellent
and very simple and the most
common form today. It differs from the
crank lever only in the action of the roller.
The impulse pin instead of projecting
beyond the edge of the roller is set within
its circumference and raised above its
plane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Lever—Two
Pin</span>—A form of Lever
Escapement in which the unlocking

were formerly divided between
two small gold pins in the
roller and one in the lever.
Later the two roller pins were discarded,
and one broad jewel pin substituted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement—Pin Wheel</span>—Invented
by Lepaute about
1750. Similar in action to the
dead-beat. A good and simple
escapement for large clocks.
The impulse is given the pendulum
through the pallets by
pins which stand out from the
face of the escape wheel.
Lepaute made these pins semi-circular
and had his pallets of equal length acting
on opposite sides of the wheel. Sir E.
Beckett cut away part of the front of the
pins which allows the pallets to act as
in the diagram. The resting faces are
arcs of a circle. It has been superseded by
the gravity escapement for large clocks
and is inferior to the dead-beat for small.</p>

only at each alternate vibration.
A much lighter

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Escapement, Verge</span>—Also
called "Crown-wheel,"
or Vertical escapement.
The earliest
form of escapement on record. The inventor
is not known, but the escapement
was used on de Vick's clock. (1364.) It
was used almost exclusively up to 1750 in
spite of its manifest inaccuracy. The verge
is a frictional recoil escapement. It consists
of a crown-wheel, with eleven, thirteen,
or fifteen teeth, shaped like those of
a rip saw, and with its axis set at right
angles to the pallets axis, or verge, which
carries the balance. The verge is a slender
cylinder as small as compatible with the
required strength, from which project
the pallets, two flat steel "flags"—at an
angle to each other varying from 90&deg; to
115&deg;. The wheel runs in a watch in a plane
at right angles to the face. Any variation
in the motive power causes a variation in
the arc of the balance swing. Therefore,
since the time of oscillation depends on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>the arc of the swing, the time-keeping
qualities were directly affected. This gave
rise to the invention of the stack-freed
and fusee, both contrivances to equalize
the power of the mainspring. In spite of
the many defects the verge escapement
was one of the great inventions because
the first escapement, and was used for
centuries before superior kinds were devised.
It necessitated thick and bulky
watches.</p>

<img src="images/i_272a.jpg" width="300" height="238" alt="fusee" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fusee</span>—Invented by
Jacob Zech of Prague
about 1525. Consists of
a specially grooved
cone-shaped pulley interposed
between the
mainspring barrel and the great or driving
wheel of a watch or clock. The connection
between the barrel and fusee was first
made by a cord or catgut, later by a chain.
In winding the spring the cord is drawn
from the barrel on to the fusee—the first
coil on the larger end. Thus the mainspring
when fully wound uncoils the cord
first from the smaller end of the fusee; and
as it runs down gets the benefit of increased
leverage by reason of the greater
diameter of the lower part of the fusee.
An excellent adjustment of the pressure
on the center pinion can be made in this
way. The fusee has been abandoned in
watches to allow of thinness, but is still
used in chronometers and clocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fusee Cap</span>—A thin steel plate with a

a swinging chandelier in a certain cathedral
took the same length of time to
each vibration whether in long or short
arcs—timing them by his pulse. He seems
never to have applied this principle to
clocks, although he issued an essay on the
subject in 1639.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galileo, Vincentis</span>—Son of the great

the Babylonian priest and astronomer,
Berosus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henlein, Peter</span>—Sometimes called
Peter Hele. A clockmaker of Nuremberg,
who is believed to have made the <em>first</em>
portable (pocket) clock or <em>watch</em> sometime
early in the sixteenth century. Born 1480.
Died about 1540. His clock was round,
driven by a spring and had small wheels
of steel. It was much larger than present
day watches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollow Pinion</span>—A pinion bored
through the center. The center pinion in
many watches is hollow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Hon-Woo-Et-Low" or Copper Jars
Dropping Water</span>—A form of clepsydra
at Canton, China, said to be between
3000 and 4000 years old. It consists of
four copper jars arranged on steps. Each
jar drops water into the one below it until
the last one, in which a bamboo float,
indicates the time in a rude way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooke, Robert, M. D.</span>—An English
physician-philosopher born on the Isle
of Wight in 1635. His accomplishments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>were numerous. He claimed to have discovered
the isochronism of the balance
spring and its application to watches,
though this was also claimed by Huyghens.
He invented a pendulum timekeeper for
finding the longitude at sea; devised the
first wheel-cutting engine about 1670; and
he invented the anchor escapement for
clocks. His studies and inventions covered
a wide field. He died in 1702.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horology</span>-The science of time-measurement
or of the construction of time
pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hour</span>—Now consisting of sixty minutes
or one twenty-fourth of an equinoctial
day. Formerly one twelfth of the
time between sunrise and sunset, and one
twelfth of the time between sunset and
sunrise; hence of different lengths for
day and night in the different seasons.
This required much adjustment of clocks;
and automatic devices for such adjustment
were in great demand. A standard
hour of uniform length for all times and
seasons was not adopted in Paris—the
last place to change—until 1816.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Hour-Glass"></a>Hour-Glass</span>—A device for measuring
hours. It has two cone-shaped superimposed
glass globes connected at their
apexes through a small opening. The
glass contains just that quantity of sand,
or mercury, as will flow in one hour
through the opening from the upper
globe to the lower. When it
has run through the glass
is reversed. See: <i><a href="#Sand-Glass">Sand Glass</a></i>.
Like the sun-dial and the
clepsydra, the hour-glass is
older than we know. Its use
probably followed close upon
that of the clepsydra, or
may even have preceded it
in dry countries like Egypt
and Babylonia, where sand
was all about and water was not a thing
to waste. Of its original forms there is
no authentic record. Dry sand does not,
like water, run faster or slower through
a given opening according to the pressure
from above; its rate is the same whether
the upper glass is full or nearly empty.
Also the hour-glass never needs to be
refilled, but only to be reversed, and
the same sand used over and over again.
On the other hand, its convenience diminished
as its size increased. It was
too clumsy for use if made large enough
to run without attention for more than
an hour or two; and in so large a glass
there was more danger that the sand,
however dry, might cake up and stop
running. It must somehow have been
transparent for convenient reading, because
sand can register the time only by
its flow: it cannot be made to raise a float
or work a pointer. But the Egyptians
very early learned to manufacture glass,
and there were other substances. A legend
ascribes the invention of the sand-glass to
Luitprand, a Carthusian monk of the
Eighth Century A. D. But this, if there is
any truth in the story at all, must have
been some improvement or reinvention
after the forgetfulness of the Dark Ages.
The device is plainly shown in Greek
sculptures antedating the Christian era.
Nowadays the sand-glass has pretty much
disappeared, except as a kitchen timepiece
for boiling eggs and the like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hour Hand</span>—The hand of a watch or

a regular apprenticeship in clockmaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>he entered into partnership with D. P.
Davis, at the age of 29, to make clocks.
He was a clever mechanic and invented
many pieces of mechanism, among them
the swing rest. In 1849 he and Davis with
A. L. Dennison and others organized the
American Horologe Company for the
manufacture of watches by machinery,
and with the parts interchangeable—the
American principle of today. Though
they were not financially successful the
American watch industry owes its present
day success largely to this beginning by
Edward Howard and Aaron L. Dennison.
The first company developed into the
present Waltham Company, and later
Mr. Howard established the E. Howard
Co., at Roxbury, but severed his connection
with them in 1882 and retired
from business. He died March 5, 1904.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huggeford, Ignatius</span>—An English
watchmaker, one of whose watches was

<p><span class="smcap">Hunter, George</span>—Identified with
watchmaking in America since about 1860—in
the Waltham and Elgin Companies.
He was general superintendent of the
latter from 1872 to 1903, after which he
was made consulting superintendent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huyghens, Christian</span>—A celebrated
Dutch astronomer and mathematician
born at The Hague, April 14, 1629. Although
the honor is claimed for Richard
Harris in 1641 and for Vincent Galileo in
1649 it seems historically established that
Huyghens in 1657 was the first to apply to
clocks the theory of the isochronism of the
pendulum which the great Galileo had
discovered. In 1669 he published his important
work, "Horologium Oscillatorium."
In 1673 he made the first clock
with concentric hour and minute hands.
He died in 1695.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Huyghens_Checks"></a>Huyghens' Checks</span>—The arc of a
swinging pendulum is a segment of a circle.
For perfect isochronism it should be a
cycloidal segment. To accomplish this
Huyghens fixed curved brass pieces called
checks for the cord to strike against but
he caused thereby a greater error than he
remedied. This end was later accomplished
by suspending the pendulum by means of
a flat steel strip instead of a cord; a device
credited to Robert Hooke.</p>

the early age of fifteen years he left home
and went to New York City, where he
entered the employ of his brother, Robert
H., who was then engaged in the business
of manufacturing rubber stamps. Since
1880 he has been continuously associated

Ingersoll, at Delta, Eaton County,
Michigan, he received his early education
in the public schools of his native town.
In 1879, at the age of nineteen years, he
came to New York City, and in the following
year engaged in the business of manufacturing
rubber stamps; later, he established
a mail order business, selling various
"dollar" specialties and novelties.
While engaged in this business he conceived
the idea and in 1892 commenced
the manufacture of the "dollar watch,"
since which time over 50,000,000 watches
have been produced and sold by the Ingersoll
organization. Married June 20,

<p><span class="smcap">Ingersoll, William Harrison</span>—Marketing
Manager of Robert H. Ingersoll

years' technical training for electrical
engineer. In 1901 he entered business
in the retail sporting goods store of <abbr title="Robert">Robt.</abbr>
H. Ingersoll &amp; <abbr title="Brothers">Brothers.</abbr> in New York City
and was soon placed in charge of the
Ingersoll watch advertising, over which
he exercised close supervision ever since,
except for two periods prior to 1908, when
he sought and gained valuable outside
experience in other capacities, such as
salesman and as manager of the Ingersoll
watch business in Canada; he then became
advertising manager, later sales and
advertising manager and then general
marketing manager for developing all
markets of all countries of the world for
the Ingersoll products. Active in the
promotion of advertising research, Mr.
Ingersoll was one of the founders of
Truth in Advertising work, assisted in
establishing a Fellowship in Advertising
Research at Columbia University, New
York City, and has written and lectured
extensively on salesmanship, advertising,
marketing and related subjects. His
residence is at Maplewood, New Jersey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ingold, Franz</span>—A Swiss watchmaker
who had the idea of making watch parts
on the interchangeable plan long before
it was put into practice anywhere. He was
ill-received by labor and capital alike
when he presented his plans in France,
England, and America. In England he was
nearly mobbed. In 1842-43 he obtained
patents on some machinery in this line,
but the machines were clumsy and for the
most part impracticable. There has been
a tendency to credit Ingold as the source
of Dennison's ideas on this subject, though
Dennison says he never heard of Ingold
until after he had started manufacturing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Intercalary</span>—Introduced or added

<p><span class="smcap">Interchangeability</span>—America's
greatest contribution to watchmaking has
been the standardizing of parts and the

alike, in great quantities. So that repairing
an American watch is largely a matter of
obtaining a new part similar to the damaged
one, and simply putting it in place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Invar</span>—An alloy of nickel and steel
claimed to be non-magnetizable. Used for
certain parts of watches at the time when
non-magnetizable watches were desirable.

clock maker of Lille, employed
by the Duke of
Burgundy in 1442. The lack

business and opened a market for American
clocks in Europe. Born in Canaan,
Connecticut, in 1793. Established the
Jerome Clock Company at New Haven,
Connecticut. This was the predecessor
of The New Haven Clock Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jewelled</span>—Fitted with precious stones
to diminish wear as distinguished from
precious stones for ornament. In the best
watches ruby and sapphire are used. In
lower grade watches quartz, amethyst and
garnet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jewels</span>—Used in watches as bushings
at the ends of pivots and in other places
which sustain much wear. They:</p>


<ul><li>1. Provide smooth bearings for the pivots.</li>

<li>2. Obviate corrosion.</li>

<li>3. Reduce the wear from abrasion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sapphire is the best of the jewels in use
and ruby second. Chrysolite is also used
and garnet, tho the latter is too brittle
for most service. This use of jewels was
invented by Nicolas Facio—a Swiss
watchmaker about 1705.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julian Period</span>—A period of 7980

He studied physics, mechanics and astronomy
in Paris and London and finally
settled in Locle, Switzerland, specializing
in pocket chronometers, which have become
famous as the Jurgensen watches.
He died in 1877; and was succeeded by his
son, Jules F. U. Jurgensen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jurgensen, Urban</span>—A Danish mathematician

Important to the watch business
because of the famous Kew tests of timekeepers
and awards for accuracy of performance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keyless Watches</span>—Watches winding
without a key. Such watches were made
as early as 1686 but did not come into
general use until 1843, when Adrien
Phillipe (Geneva) introduced the "shifting
clutch" type, and when the "rocking
bar" mechanism was introduced in 1855.
These are the types in use today. Self-winding
watches have been made from
time to time. Napoleon is said to have had
one which wound automatically from the
motion of being carried. The abandonment
of the key nullified the usefulness of
the fusee, although some keyless fusee
movements were attempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knuckles</span>—The rounded parts of a
watchcase that form the hinges or joints.
Usually two on the cover.</p>

to by Lalaude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lepire, Jean Antoine</span>—Born 1720.
Died 1814. A celebrated watchmaker of
Paris in the 18th century. About 1770 he
introduced bars to take the place of a top
plate, omitted the fusee, used a cylinder
escapement and supported his mainspring
barrel arbor at one end only. He attempted
to establish a watch factory for Voltaire
at Ferney but with no success. He is
sometimes credited with making the first
thin watch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Le Roy, Julien</span>—1686-1759. A French

of a pendulum vibrating in a
cycloidal arc was first discovered by
Galileo but he did not apply it to clocks.
Most authorities credit Christian Huyghens
with that adaptation to instruments

suspended by a silk cord and thus vibrated
in a circular instead of cycloidal

Hooke succeeded in remedying it by
suspending the pendulum by a flat ribbon

<p><span class="smcap">Stackfreed</span>—The derivation

is possibly Persian. A device
to counteract the difference
in power of the mainspring at
the different stages of its unwinding.
Fixed to the mainspring arbor above the
top plate is a pinion having eight leaves,
which gears with a wheel having twenty-four
teeth, which do not quite fill out the
circumference of the wheel. Fastened to
the wheel is a cam, concentric for about
seven-eighths of its circumference and
indented for the remainder. Into a groove
in the concentric portion of the edge is
pressed a roller which is pivoted at the
free end of a strong curved spring. When
the mainspring is fully wound the roller
rests in the curved depression of the cam
and the effort required to lift the roller
up the incline absorbs some of the mainspring's
power. On the other hand when
the mainspring is nearly run down, the
roller is descending an inclined plane
and absorbs less of the power. Not an
acceptable device and now rarely met
with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Sun-Dial"></a>Sun-Dial</span>—A device for telling time by
the shadow of a style, cast by the sun, as
thrown upon a disk or plate marked with
the hour lines. Dials were named from
their positions—equinoctial or equatorial;
east; erect or vertical; horizontal; inclining,
etc., or from their purpose or method
of use, as portable, reflecting, etc., or as
in the case of the ring-dial, from their form.
The word is derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies</i>.
The style in the earliest dials was a vertical
staff, but later it was found that
reasonable accuracy could only be obtained
by a style set parallel to the earth's
axis—that is, inclined to the horizontal
at the angle of latitude of the locality in
which the dial was set.</p>

<p>Even before the first astronomical discoveries
of the Babylonians, people had
felt some need of a convenient device to
mark and measure the passing of the time,
especially the shorter divisions of recurring
time, the time of day. Sunrise and
sunset marked themselves by the horizon,
but noon was harder to determine, and the
points of mid-morning and mid-afternoon
harder still. And with the knowledge of
those regular movements in the heavens
which determine time on earth, and with
the closer division of the day into its hours,
that need became a sheer necessity.</p>

<p>The obvious measure of the sun's movements
was the moving shadow cast by the
sun itself. And the earliest device for
recording time was naturally the sun-dial.
Its origin fades into the twilight of antiquity.
Long before we know anything
about him, primitive man measured the
moving shadow of some tree. And it occurred
to him to set up a post or pillar in
some convenient place, and mark out the
positions into which the shadow swung.
The earliest sun-dials were of this pattern,
with a vertical pointer of <i>gnomon</i>, and the
hours marked upon the ground. And it is
related of the early Greeks that they told
the time individually by marking and
measuring the length of their own shadows.
But the measure of time by the
length of a shadow is very irregular at
best, because of the yearly motion of the
sun. The shortest shadow of the day will
indeed fall at noon. But that noon shadow
will vary in length according as the sun's
noon is high in Summer or low in Winter;
and so the whole scale of lengths will be
different for every day in the year. If a
three foot shadow means mid-afternoon
today, it will mean quite another time
tomorrow. And for measuring by the
<em>direction of the</em> shadow, the vertical
gnomon is more irregular still. For the
swing of the shadow would depend not
only upon the sun's motion across the sky
from East to West, but also upon his
slant North and South along the sky.
And this would change from day to day.
The difficulty was to make a dial of which
the shadow would move as regularly as
the sun moves.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a id="i_287"></a>
<img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="300" height="277" alt="ANCIENT GREEK HEMICYCLE" />
<p class="caption">ANCIENT GREEK HEMICYCLE</p>
</div>

<p>This the ancients accomplished in a
very simple and ingenious way. The sun
moves in the sky as it were upon the inner
surface of a hollow globe or sphere. So
they made the dial a little hemisphere,
place with its hollow side up toward the
sky as a bowl
stands on a
table. The
pointer was
placed above
and to the
South of this,
on the side toward
the sun;
and the Time
was marked
by the shadow
of the tip end of the pointer which was
a little ball or bead. The path of this
shadow across the bowl reproduced exactly
on a small scale the path of the sun
across the great bowl of the heavens.
And it was then an easy matter to mark
off the bowl into equal divisions which the
shadow would cross at equal intervals of
the day. Of course, the track of the shadow
changed with the season of the year. But
it moved always as the sun moved, and
just as regularly, giving a true measure
of the solar day.</p>

<p>The principle of this was applied in
several interesting variations. The defect
of the Hemicycle, as this hollow type of
dial was called, was that it could not be
read accurately for short intervals. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>shadow moving only a few inches in the
whole day must
move so slowly that
one could hardly see
it move at all. To
mark the minutes,
it must move faster,
just as the minute
hand of your watch
moves faster than
the hour hand, and
the second hand
faster still. One cannot
read seconds
from the hour hand,
however accurately it moves, because it
moves so slowly. So the idea was applied
by making the shadow move across a
street or courtyard, down one side and
across and up the other side, as the sun
opposite went up and across and down
the sky. Sometimes the place was partly
roofed over, and a single beam of light
admitted through a small hole at the
South end. The resulting spot of light
would then move in the same way. The
long sunbeam or shadow moved faster,
and so could be read at shorter intervals.
The Hemicycle is not certainly known to
have been invented until long after this,
about B. C. 350. But the principle of it is
so simple and so entirely such as would
occur to an intelligent man still ignorant
of its mathematical explanation, that we
may not unreasonably suppose it to have
been discovered by experiments long
before.</p>

<p class="caption">ANCIENT ROMAN HEMICYCLE</p>
</div>

<p>The final improvement of the sundial
was the discovery that by slanting the
gnomon so that it pointed exactly toward
the North Pole of the sky, the direction
of its shadow could be made to show the
solar time correctly. Since the sky is infinitely
far away, the line of the gnomon
would then lie parallel to the axis of the
heavens. And the sun, moving parallel to
the celestial Equator, would always move
straight across the gnomon. In other
words, he would practically revolve
around its sloping edge. Therefore the
North and South motion of the sun would
be as it were along the edge of the gnomon,
and would not influence the direction of
the shadow at all. His East and West
motion alone would govern the swing of
the shadow; and the dial would keep true
time with the sun for every day in the
year. There was no longer any necessity
for hollowing out the dial itself into the
concave form; it might just as well be the
more convenient flat surface, and this
might be either vertical or horizontal,
so long as the gnomon pointed straight to
the Celestial Pole. All that was needed
was to mark out on the dial the true direction
in which the shadow fell for each
hour of the day.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 148px;"><a id="i_288b"></a>

<p class="caption center">OLD ENGLISH DIAL</p>
</div>

<p>Just when or by whom the instrument
was thus scientifically perfected is not
known. The calculations necessary to the
projection of the hour lines upon a flat
surface could hardly have been performed
before Greek times. The Greeks
ascribed the invention of the sundial to
Anaximander, in the sixth century B. C.,
but sundials of various types had been
known in various parts of the world long
before then. On the other hand, the
Hemicycle remained the common form
of the instrument all through the classic
period and even afterwards. The Babylonians
were quite capable of understanding
the principle of the sloping gnomon.
And once this was discovered, it would
have been entirely practical to set up the
new dial beside a Hemicycle or Clepsydra,
and find the angles of the hour lines by
experiment. These, once laid out correctly,
would be determined once for all. Even
at its best the sundial had certain very
marked limitations. Scientifically constructed,
it would keep accurate time
according to the visible sun. But it could
not be read accurately unless made inconveniently
large. It was inaccurate
when removed from its original latitude,
or displaced from a true North and South
position; so that in any portable form it
became a very rough measure indeed.
Moreover, it was of course entirely useless
at night or in bad weather or in shadow.
And finally, it was never absolutely
exact under the most
ideal conditions, because of
what is known as the Equation
of Time. The Earth does
not, in fact, move around the
sun at an absolutely regular
rate of speed; it moves a trifle
faster during certain parts of
the year and slower at others.
The sun therefore varies correspondingly
his apparent speed along the Ecliptic, so
that even from noon to noon the sun is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>not always precisely on time. He may be
as much as fifteen minutes late or early,
according to the season. And our modern
days are measured according to the sun's
average rate, so as to allow for this variation
and keep every day exactly twenty-four
hours long. This of course no sun-dial
can possibly be made to do, since it must
follow the actual sun.</p>

<p>The sun-dial has remained in use to the
present day. It seems strange to think of
a sun-dial being used as a standard for
setting clocks and actually to regulate the
running of trains. But these things were
done in civilized Europe within the last
half century. It was only when the railroad
and the telegraph had made standard
time at once necessary and easy to
obtain that the sun-dial altogether lost its
position of authority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun-Dials, Descriptions</span>—Classical
sun-dials were of many forms. Vitruvius,
the Roman engineer, mentions thirteen,
some of them portable; and ascribes the
invention of the Hemicycle to the Babylonian
astronomer and priest, Berosus.
There was a famous dial of this type at the
base of Cleopatra's Needle in Egypt. It is
now at the British Museum. And the
Emperor Augustus, returning from his
Egyptian wars, brought home to Rome
an obelisk which he set up as the gnomon
of a huge dial in the Campus Martius.
At Athens there was the famous Tower of
the Winds; octagonal in shape, with a
weather vane above, and below around
the tower, the hours and the winds, to
each of which the Greeks gave a personality
and a name. There is a curious bit of
accidental poetry in the marking of the
sun-dial in Greece. The Greek numerals,
like the Roman, were simply the letters
of their alphabet arranged in a certain
order. The hot hours of the day from noon
to four o'clock were those commonly devoted
by the Greeks to rest and recreation.
Reckoning the day from sunrise, this
period ran from the sixth hour through
the ninth. And the numeral letters for
Six, Seven, Eight and Nine, which marked
those hours upon the dial, spell out the
Greek word ΖἩΟΙ, the imperative of the
verb to <em>live</em>. The poet Lucian thus points
the moral:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Six hours to labor, four to leisure give;</div>
      <div class="verse">In them—so say the dialled hours—LIVE.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The shepherds of the Pyrenees still consult
their pocket dials. And the Turk
makes a sun-dial of his two hands by holding
them up with the tips of the thumbs
joined horizontally and the forefingers
extended upward; so that the shadow of
one forefinger falls toward the other and
by its position roughly indicates the time.
But even now, when it has nearly gone
from practical use, the sun-dial, as an appropriate
adornment of our public parks
and our private gardens, is becoming increasingly
fashionable in our own generation.</p>

<p>Sun-dials are common in almost
all parts of the world, and not a
few of them have in one way or
another become famous. The
largest is at Jaipur in India, and
was erected about 1730. Its
gnomon is ninety feet high and
one hundred and forty-seven feet
long. A flight of stone steps run
up the slope of it, and at the top
there is a sort of little watch-tower.
And the shadow, which falls
upon a great stone quadrant instead
of upon a flat surface, moves
at the rate of two and a half inches
a minute. Another great dial is
the so-called Calendar Stone of Mexico,
which was made by the Aztec priests
more than a hundred years before
the Spaniards came. It weighs nearly
fifty tons, and is not only a sun-dial but
a representation of the zodiac and a diagram
of the astronomical changes of the
year: thus showing that the ancient Mexicans
in their own way paralleled the
astrology of the Babylonians on the other
side of the world. Probably the most
expensive and elaborate sun-dial ever built
was the one set up in 1669 by King Charles
<abbr title="the second">II</abbr> of England in front of the banqueting
house at White Hall in London. It was in
the form of a tall pyramid on which were
two hundred and seventy-one different
dials, giving not only the hour of the day
but various astronomical and geographical
indications as well. The place called
Seven Dials in London takes its name
from a tall pillar with sun-dials around its
top which used to stand at the junction of
seven streets radiating starwise from that
spot as a center. The pillar was overthrown
in 1773 by a party of vandals
digging for buried treasure which they believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>to have been hidden
beneath its base. Extensive list,

<p><span class="smcap">Sun-Dial, Hollow</span>—A form
of sun-dial invented by the
Chaldean Berosus. A hollow
hemisphere with a bead at its
center, whose shadow indicated
the hour of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun-Dial, Mottoes</span>—On nearly all
sun-dials both ancient and modern there
there is inscribed a motto—usually of the
moral significance of the passage of time.</p>

<p>Very ancient also, as well as equally
common in modern times is the custom of
placing upon the sun-dial some appropriate
motto expressive of the mystery of
Time. There are hundreds of such mottoes,
ranging in sentiment from the old
Roman one: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Horas non numero nisi
Serenas</i>. "I number no hours but the fair
ones," to the couplet of a modern poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Time flies, you say? Ah no,</div>
      <div class="verse">Alas! Time stays; we go."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And these two thoughts, expressed in
many forms, represent fairly the tenor of
most of them. There is a story of a lazy
apprentice asking a motto for his dial, to
whom his master sharply replied: "Begone
about your business!" and the fellow,
appropriately enough, took that for
the motto required. It is at least a familiar
sentiment, especially in Puritan times;
and equally so during
the Middle Ages is that
more mystic suggestion,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Umbra Dei</i>—"the Shadow
of God."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Sun-Dial_Portable"></a>Sun-Dial, Portable</span>—Made
in different shapes
and upon different plans
small enough to carry
about. The most common form was the
ring dial, consisting of a metal ring with
a hole in it through which the light fell
upon an inside ring adjustable to the day
and month. It required careful orienting
to be dependable as a time-indicator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun-Dials, Roman</span>—The first dial in
Rome was set up B. C. 293 near the temple
of Quirinus by Papirius Cursor. It
served ninety-nine years; then one more
accurate was set up beside it. Before that,
no time was noted except the rising and
setting of the sun. Emperor Augustus
erected a dial at Campus Martius. A dial
captured in Sicily during the first Punic
war was set up in the Forum about 263
B. C. and used for years before they
learned that it was inaccurate in that latitude,
being designed for the latitude of
Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunk-Seconds</span>—A dial in which the
seconds circle is sunk below the rest of
the dial. It allows the hour hand to be
placed closer to the face thus making a
thinner model possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Supplementary Arc</span>—See: "Lifting
Arc."</p>

<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">Table Roller</span>—The roller of a lever
escapement which carries the impulse
pin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tell-Tale Clock</span>—A clock by which
a record is left of periodical visits of some
one as a night-watchman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Template or Timplet</span>—One of the
four facets that surround a cut gem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tenon</span>—A projection at the end of a
piece cut to fit into a corresponding mortise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terry, Eli</span>—The first man to make
clocks by machinery in America. When it
was learned that he planned to make two
hundred clocks he was much laughed at.
He was born at East Windsor, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>, in
1772. His first clocks were made by hand,
the movements being of wood. He was the
leading maker of wooden clocks in America.
He invented the shelf clock which
contained distinctly new inventions and
he introduced the pillar scroll-top case.
He was a mechanical genius and contributed
a great deal to developing clock-making
in America into a great industry.
He died in 1852.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Third Wheel</span>—The wheel in the train
between the center wheel and the fourth
wheel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thales</span>—A celebrated Ionian astronomer,
one of the Seven Sages of Greece.
He was born about 640 B. C., and is
credited by Herodotus with having predicted
an eclipse of the sun occurring about
609 B. C. He was the author of several
solutions of geometrical problems. He
died about 550 B. C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas, Seth</span>—Born at Wolcott,
<abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>, 1785. A very successful clockmaker
who contributed probably more than any
other man toward popularizing the modern
cheap clock. The Seth Thomas Clock
Co., of today, he started in 1813 with
twenty operatives. By 1853 it had nine
hundred. He died in 1859.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three-Quarter Plate</span>—A three-quarter
plate watch is one in which there
is a piece cut out from the top plate large
enough to permit the balance to rotate on
a level with that plate. It is the most
common form at present in use in both
cheap and high grade watches, and found
in both "pillar" and "bridge" models.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Time-Candles</span>—Candles in
alternate black and white
sections were used to mark
the passage of time in Europe
and Asia for a long time. In
England and France they were
used to limit the bidding at
an auction. The phrase "by
inch of candle" meant that
the one bidding when the
flame expired was the successful
bidder. King Alfred is said
to have used time-candles and to have
inclosed them in thin horn plates to protect
them from drafts, thus originating
the lantern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timekeeper</span>—Any device primarily
concerned with measuring and indicating
the sub-divisions of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tompion, Thomas</span>—"The father of
English Watchmaking." Born 1638. He
was the leading watchmaker at the court
of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>. He found the construction
of the time-keeping part of watches in a
very indifferent condition and he left
English clocks and watches the finest in
the world, although many great improvements
were made after his time. He associated
closely with such scientists as
Hooke, and Barlow, and made practical
application of their theories—two notable
instances being the cylinder escapement
and the balance-spring. Tompion was the
first to number his watches consecutively
for the purpose of identification though
he did not so mark his early ones.
There is a famous clock in the pumproom
at Bath, England, of Tompion's construction.
Little is known of his domestic life
but he appears to have been unmarried.
He died in 1713 and is buried in Westminster
Abbey. Tompion was master of
the Worshipful Clockmakers' Company
in 1704.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Top_Plate"></a>Top Plate</span>—The plate in a watch
farthest from the dial. In full plate
watches it is circular; in three-quarter
plate or half-plate watches a part is cut
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tower of the Winds</span>—An octagonal
tower north of the Acropolis of Athens
spoken of as horological by Vario and
Vitruvius. Believed to have had a sundial
on each of its eight faces and to have contained
a clepsydra fed by a spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Train</span>—The toothed wheels of a watch
or clock which connect the barrel or fusee
with the escapement. In a going-barrel
watch the teeth about the barrel drive the
center pinion which drives the center
wheel and then in turn the third wheel
pinion, third wheel, fourth wheel pinion
and fourth wheel, escape pinion and
escape wheel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tripping</span>—The running past the pallet's
locking face, of an escape wheel tooth.</p>


<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">Vacheron and Constantin</span>—In 1840
established the first <em>complete</em> watch
factory in Switzerland. Not until later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>however, was motor power used instead of
foot-power; and later still manufacture
by machinery. The work in this factory is
carried on under a combination of all
accepted methods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vailly, Dom</span>—A Benedictine monk of
about 1690 who made a water clock which
Beckmann says was the first to be constructed
on a really scientific principle.

<p><span class="smcap">Van der Woerd, Charles</span>—A prominent
man in connection with watch manufacturing
in this country. In 1864 he

1874 an automatic screw machine. From
1876-1883 he was superintendent of the
Waltham factory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Verge</span>—The pallet axis of the verge

<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">Wallingford, Richard</span>—An English
mechanic and astronomer of the
fourteenth century. He made a clock
which is supposed to have been the first
that was regulated by a fly-wheel. Several
authorities, however, claim that Wallingford's
"clock" was actually a planetarium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waltham</span>—A town in Massachusetts—the
site of the first successful watch factory
in America. At present a great watch

<p><span class="smcap">Watch</span>—In modern parlance, a small
timepiece to carry about on the person.
Formerly a timepiece which <em>showed</em> time
in distinction to clock which <em>struck</em> time.
Derham (1734) uses the term to indicate
all timepieces driven by springs. The term
may have been derived from the Swedish
<i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">vacht</i>, German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wachen</i>, or Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">woecca</i>.
The spaces of time between the fillings of
a clepsydra were also called "watches."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Watchmakers' Schools</span>—American.
In America these schools usually teach
watch-repairing and not the making of
watches. Some of them offer courses in
making watches but few pupils avail
themselves of these courses. List of: De

<p><span class="smcap">Watchmakers' Schools, Switzerland</span>—Usually
under government management.
Teach very thoroughly and
completely the art of making a watch
from the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Watch-Papers</span>—During the 18th century
it was a fad in England and America
to carry small round papers, which exactly
fitted the case of a watch. On these
were portraits and verses, the latter of
doubtful merit and usually of sinister or
gloomy significance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waterbury</span>—A town in Connecticut

in America. Home of the original Waterbury
watch. Location of principal factory
of <abbr title="Robert">Robt.</abbr> H. Ingersoll &amp; <abbr title="Brothers">Brothers.</abbr>, manufacturers
of the Ingersoll watches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water-Clock</span>—Any device, as a clepsydra,
for measuring time by the fall or
flow of water. More commonly applied to
the type in which wheels are turned by
water or in such as those in which water
sets machinery of some form in motion
as <i>Vailly's water-clock</i>. See <i><a href="#Vaillys">Clock,
Vailly's</a></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wick Timekeeper</span>—A wick or rope
made of some fiber resembling flax or
hemp with knots tied at regular intervals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>and so treated that upon ignition it would
smolder instead of breaking into flame.
Early in use in Japan and China. Time
was estimated by the burning between
the knots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wieck, Henry De</span>—See <i><a href="#de_Vick">De Vick</a></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willard, Aaron</span>—Born 1757. Probably
learned his trade from his older
brothers Simon and Benjamin. He made
tall, and shelf clocks, later banjo clocks—so-called
from their shape—gallery clocks,
and regulators. A better business man
than his brothers and successful from the
start. His clocks did not lack decorative
merit but were inferior to Simon Willard's.
He made a greater number than his
brother because more successful in a business
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willard, Benjamin</span>—Older brother of
Simon and Aaron Willard. Among the first
of American clockmakers. Born 1743.
Made, probably, only tall clocks with
handsome cases and some with musical
attachments. Not so good as the clocks of
Aaron and Simon Willard but older and
rarer now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willard, Simon</span>—Born at Grafton,
<abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, 1753. One of the earliest Massachusetts
clock makers who disputed the
claim of the Connecticut makers for the
credit of revolutionizing the clock industry
in America. So far as cases go they
excelled Terry, Thomas, and others. But
to the Connecticut makers belongs the
credit for having developed clock making
into a great industry. Willard at first made
eight-day tall clocks and shelf clocks, later
wall clocks which he called "time pieces."
In 1802 he practically abandoned the
making of tall clocks, and confined himself
to his "time pieces" and special
orders for tower and gallery clocks. For a
detailed list of his productions see his
Biography by John Ware Willard. He was
an intimate friend of Jefferson, Madison
and other leading men of the time. Died
1848.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worshipful Clockmakers' Company
of London, The</span>—Incorporated August
22, 1631, under special charter by King
Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> of England. Was given the sole
privilege of regulating the watch and
clock trade in and for ten miles around
London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Webster, Ambrose</span>—Mechanical superintendent,
and later assistant superintendent,
of the Waltham factory until his
resignation in 1876. He systematized the
work in the shop, standardized the measuring
system, and forced automatic
machinery to the front. He designed the
first watch factory lathe with hard
spindles and bearings of the two taper
variety. He made the first interchangeable
standard for parts of lathes. He invented
many machines now in use, among them
being the automatic pinion cutter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weight-Clock</span>—A clock whose driving
power is a weight suspended by a cord
wound on a drum or cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weights</span>—The first clocks were made
with a weight on a cord which was wound
around a cylinder connected with the train.
The weight descending caused the cylinder
to revolve, setting the train in motion.
Too rapid unwinding was prevented
by the escapement. The weight as a driving
power is still used, especially in large
clocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheel, Count</span>—The wheel carrying
the locking-plate in a striking mechanism.</p>


<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">Year</span>—Astronomically, the period of
time occupied by the earth in making
one complete revolution around the sun.
The calendar year is an arbitrarily determined
division of time, approximating
more or less closely the astronomical year.
See <i><a href="#Gregorian">Calendar, Gregorian</a></i>.</p>


<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">Zech, Jacob</span>—Of Prague. Invented the

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a id="i_294"></a>
<img src="images/i_294.jpg" width="300" height="299" alt="Zodiac" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Zodiac</span>—An imaginary belt 16 degrees
in width, spread equally on both sides
of the ecliptic (q. v.). It is divided into
twelve sections or "signs" which receive
their distinguishing names from the twelve
principal constellations within the belt.
That is how the Babylonians learned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>tell the time by looking at the sun and the
stars. Only their whole problem was
vastly complicated by the daily rotation
of the earth
on its axis,
which of
course makes
the whole sky
seem to turn
in the opposite
direction
day by day.
The earth
turns in the
same direction
that it goes
round the sun, from West to East. So the
heavens turn apparently from East to
West, while the annual motion, as we saw
just now by the illustration of the clock
face, appears in its true direction, Eastward.
Also, the great clock of the sky is
not from our point of view horizontal,
but stood up on edge; and not straight
up and down even, but slanted at an
angle. So its apparent movements are as
it were in several directions at once, and
the effect is very confusing. The real motions
as they actually do occur are very
much simpler and easier to understand.
But of these the Babylonians had no idea.
They knew only what they could see; and
it is all the more wonderful that they contrived
to reason out so much and so
correctly.</p>

<p>They mapped out a belt or zone around
the sky, with the Ecliptic along the middle
of it. This they divided into twelve equal
parts of thirty degrees each, called Signs
or Houses, and each containing a constellation.
These constellations were in
order, <i>Aries</i> or the Ram; <i>Taurus</i> or the
Bull; <i>Gemini</i> or the Twins; <i>Cancer</i> or the
Crab; <i>Leo</i> or the Lion; <i>Virgo</i> or the Virgin;
<i>Libra</i> or the Scales; <i>Scorpio</i> or the Scorpion;
<i>Sagittarius</i> or the Archer; <i>Capricornus</i>
or the Goat; <i>Aquarius</i> or the
Water-Carrier; and <i>Pisces</i> or the Fishes.
We know these by their Latin names, and
the whole zone by its Greek name of The
Zodiac. But their original titles were
much the same, only in a different language.
The sun went through one of these
constellations each month; and by his position
along the Zodiac they told the time
of year. Thus the Spring Equinox was
where the sun entered the House of the
Ram; and that was for the ancients the
first day of the new year. The House of
the Crab was farthest North, and when
the sun got there it was midsummer.
The Autumn Equinox was in the House
of the Scales; and when the sun reached
the House of the Goat, he would be at the
Southern or Winter end of his journey.
Moreover, since the Moon and the Planets
always keep close to the Ecliptic, their
apparent motions all lie within the
Zodiacal zone. And the Zodiac therefore
represented the most important part of
the heavens from the standpoint of keeping
time; the part, that is, wherein all of
those bodies which moved among the
stars month by month and day by day
appeared to have their motions.</p>
